these bodies contained cytoplasmic ribosomes, rer, mitochondria, lipid granules and glycogen granules, and the density of the cytoplasmic ribosomes in the bodies was almost the same as that of ribosomes in the cytosol. the diameter of the bodies ranged from 400 to 900 nm. vacuoles that had accumulated these bodies were prepared by a modification of the method of ohsumi and anraku (ohsumi, y., and y. anraku. 1981. j. biol. chem. 256:2079-2082). the isolated vacuoles contained ribosomes and showed latent activity of the cytosolic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. these results suggest that these bodies sequestered the cytosol in the vacuoles. we named these spherical bodies \"autophagic bodies.\" accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuoles was induced not only by nitrogen starvation, but also by depletion of nutrients such as carbon and single amino acids that caused cessation of the cell cycle. genetic analysis revealed that the accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuoles was the result of lack of the prb1 product proteinase b, and disruption of the prb1 gene confirmed this result. in the presence of pmsf, wild-type cells accumulated autophagic bodies in the vacuoles under nutrient-deficient conditions in the same manner as did multiple protease-deficient mutants or cells with a disrupted prb1 gene. as the autophagic bodies disappeared rapidly after removal of pmsf from cultures of normal cells, they must be an intermediate in the normal autophagic process. this is the first report that nutrient-deficient conditions induce extensive autophagic degradation of cytosolic components in the vacuoles of yeast cells.", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1992-10", "references": ["236769", "6450764", "319838", "363165", "385314", "814003", "1102534", "1652366", "1848921", "2215422", "2391370", "2526133", "2657434", "2674123", "2973058", "3017193", "3290649", "6799292", "7021321", "14907713", "3390865", "3886157", "3916861", "4604714", "5344095", "5681512", "6351921", "6352682", "6397123", "290994"], "similars": ["1400575", "8132712", "9089409", "8224160", "8825067", "26368310", "8603680", "9412464", "11707514", "11058089", "31183499", "3131304", "7068752", "6133857", "11169858", "18425455", "2161853", "30270317", "29514932", "25468960", "11566994", "36306824", "15569245", "7493651", "9639028", "8223708", "16874101", "9190802", "3972014", "385314", "30755486", "7021530", "36227834", "18391941", "3049619", "1506410", "17021250", "11675007", "10678571", "11128382", "6840208", "15985464", "8800403", "3335225", "10473633", "11840166", "14761979", "29422608", "11852075", "15221529", "14734026", "2351689", "15494556", "16751523", "6330453", "616715", "10966461", "17951700", "28331162", "2888237", "24150213", "8840499", "26477382", "1683722", "2202738", "16384793", "11062255", "16055436", "7741731", "8332133", "2307216", "26368055", "15778222", "8027189", "26940206", "2805089", "557869", "21364763", "10488097", "22692030", "24343261", "8150396", "319838", "1321157", "34176421", "1918014", "9049246", "10637306", "3391236", "12814436", "2674123", "6134384", "20856835", "29053817", "17377488", "15247238", "791099", "24489953", "25126732", "18424909", "3549451", "6799292", "31558680", "6343120", "11374441", "24589969", "32968871", "24270884", "31555857", "15358773", "8888585", "28992297", "3335254", "19182523", "31835634", "7314075", "19003024", "8664306", "670291", "7006768", "1547871", "1943851", "7445977", "8682862", "3886113", "30206767", "6609054", "12226358", "36044857", "22652877", "19502427", "6497655", "2372210", "10489408", "18220835", "24771619", "25105130", "12455967", "18621286", "16562110", "14080807", "24174061", "22508506", "19868402", "36053058", "10213781", "11946634", "15463398"]}, "refs_info": {"236769": {"title": "Proteolytic activities in yeast.", "abstract": "Studies on the mechanism and time course of the activation of proteinases A (EC 3.4.23.8), B (EC 3.4.22.9) and C (EC 3.4.12.--) in crude yeast extracts at pH 5.1 and 25 degrees C showed that the increase in proteinase B activity is paralleled with the disappearance of proteinase B inhibitor. Addition of purified proteinase A to fresh crude extracts accelerates the inactivation of the proteinase B inhibitor and the appearance of maximal activities of proteinases B and C. The decrease of proteinase B inhibitor activity and the increase of proteinase B activity are markedly retarded by the addition of pepstatin. Because 10-minus 7 M pepstatin completely inhibits proteinase A without affecting proteinase B activity, this is another indication for the role of proteinase A during the activation of proteinase B. Whereas extracts of yeast grown on minimal medium reached maximal activation of proteinases B and C after 20 h of incubation at pH 5.1 and 25 degrees C, extracts of yeast grown on complete medium had to be incubated for about 100 h. In the latter case, the addition of proteinas A results in maximal activation of proteinases B and C and disappearance of proteinase B inhibitor activity only after 10--20 h of incubation. With the optimal conditions, the maximal activities of proteinases A, B and C, as well as of the proteinase B inhibitor, were determined in crude extracts of yeast that had been grown batchwise for different lengths of time either on minimal or on complete medium. Upon incubation, all three proteinases were activated by several times their initial activity. This reflects the existence of proteolytically degradable inhibitors of the three proteinases and together with the above mentioned observations it demonstrates that the \"activation\" of yeast proteinases A, B and C upon incubation results from the proteolytic digestion of inhibitors rather than from activation of inactive zymogens by limited proteolysis.", "pubdate_sims": "1975-03-28"}, "6450764": {"title": "Active transport of basic amino acids driven by a proton motive force in vacuolar membrane vesicles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "abstract": "The mechanism of transport of basic amino acids into vacuoles of cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated in vitro.

It was exchangeable and was released completely by a protonophore, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzilidenemalononitrile (SF6847).

SF6847 or nigericin blocked arginine uptake completely, but valinomycin had no effect. ATP-dependent formation of a delta pH across the membrane vesicles was shown by quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence.

Aminopeptidase II (the other major aminopeptidase of yeast) seems to be an external enzyme, located mainly outside the plasmalemma. The synthesis of aminopeptidase I is repressed in media containing more than 1% glucose. In the presence of ammonia as the sole nitrogen source its activity is enhanced 3--10-fold when compared to that in cells grown on peptone.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate, of the proteins extracted from vegetative cells and from isolated asci and ascospores revealed that ascus formation was accompanied by a shift of the cellular proteins to a lower molecular weight. From several proteinase inhibitors tested, only tosyl-p-lysine chloromethylketone slightly reduced the rate of ascus formation. During sporulation the total activity of proteinase A increased more than twofold with a maximum at 18 h after transfer to sporulation medium. Total proteinase B activity showed a striking increase in the first hours after transfer to sporulation medium and after that remained constant throughout sporulation.

There was a 10- to 25-fold increase in specific activity of various proteinases, with a maximum activity around 20 h after transfer into the sporulation medium.

These many functions necessitate an intricate interaction between the vacuole and the rest of the cell; the vacuole is part of both the secretory and endocytic pathways and is also directly accessible from the cytosol. Because of the various roles and properties of the vacuole, it has been possible to isolate mutants which are defective in various vacuolar functions including the storage and uptake of metabolites, regulation of pH, sorting and processing of vacuolar proteins, and vacuole biogenesis.

The completeness of protection by leupeptin indicates, furthermore, that a lysosomal cysteine proteinase is obligatorily required for the initial proteolytic attack upon autophagocytosed proteins.

Because glucagon enhanced the metabolic utilization of some amino acids, the catabolic response to both of these stimuli could be achieved by a lowering of intracellular amino acid pools. Alternatively, glucagon could act independently of amino acids. To clarify the mode of hormonal action and also the relationship between the two cellular responses, livers from fed rats were perfused, with and without glucagon, with plasma amino acids over a concentration range of 0 to 10 times normal. Individual amino acids constancy at each level was ensured by perfusion in the single-pass mode. Amino acids alone strongly regulated autophagy and proteolysis in a coordinated fashion; maximal suppression was achieved at twice normal concentration; both effects increased rapidly to maximum at less than normal concentration. Corresponding effects of glucagon, however, could be elicited only at intermediate amino acid levels. None was noted at 4 and 10 times normal; at 0, hormonal stimulation was minimal. The amino acid inhibition was selective because it did not block cyclic AMP production or glycogenolysis. Intracellular pool measurements and systematic alteration of perfusate amino acid composition indicated that the autophagic and proteolytic effects of glucagon are mediated by a hormonally induced depletion of glycine, alanine, glutamate, and glutamine; of these, glutamine alone is the most effective.

In this fraction the enhanced proteolysis is associated with a threefold increase in the relative fractional volume of autophagic vacuoles (AVs). In an attempt to isolate the AVs, we subfractionated the ML suspension at different intervals after the induction of autophagy by VBL by centrifugation on a discontinuous Metrizamide gradient ranging from 50% to 15%. The material banding at the 24 to 20% and the 20 to 15% interphases was collected.

These autophagic vacuoles contain cytosol, mitochondria, portions of endoplasmic reticulum, and occasional very low density lipoprotein, particles either free or in Golgi apparatus derivatives, in particular secretory granules. The sequestered materials show ultrastructural signs of ongoing degradation. In addition to containing typical autophagic vacuoles, the isolated fractions consist of lysosomes lacking morphologically recognizable cellular components.

Initially, the yield of nonlysosomal mitochondrial and microsomal enzyme activities increases in parallel with the induction of autophagy but, later on, decreases with advanced degradation of the sequestered cell organelles. Therefore, in the case of AVs the presence of nonlysosomal marker enzymes cannot be used for calculation of fraction purity, since newly sequestered organelles are enzymatically active. Isolated autophagic vacuoles show proteolytic activity when incubated in vitro.

This system was used to determine whether cytoplasmic enzymes are normally sequestered into autophagic vacuoles in fed animals. Within 30 min following the administration of leupeptin to fed rats, several cytoplasmic enzymes could be demonstrated in vacuolar fractions heavier than mitochondria and normal lyosomes. The activities of tyrosine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase as well as antigens of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase were detectable in fractions with densities of 1.115 to 1.15 g/ml containing cathepsins and acid phosphatase. The cytoplasmic enzymes in these fractions exhibited latency and were sequestered within membranous organelles. Six hours after the administration of leupeptin, the autophagic vacuoles gradually disappeared from these fractions concurrently with the loss of both cytoplasmic and lysosomal marker enzymes. For 6 h after injection of leupeptin the activities of cathepsin D and acid phosphatase increased in autophagic vacuoles and decreased in the postvacuolar lysosomal fraction. Administration of dexamethasone, which induces the synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, selectively increased the sequestration of these enzymes to proportional degrees. Cycloheximide administered simultaneously with leupeptin rapidly inhibited formation of autophagic vacuoles and the sequestrations of both cytoplasmic and lysosomal enzymes. However, when cycloheximide was administered 1 h after leupeptin, the formation of autophagosomes and the sequestration of cytoplasmic enzymes were inhibited but the vacuolar uptake of acid phosphatase and cathepsin D continued to increase for several hours.

In the present report, the maturation of newly formed or nascent autophagic vacuoles into degradative vacuoles was examined using morphological and biochemical methods combined with immunological probes. Within 15 min of formation, autophagic vacuoles acquired acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane proteins, thus becoming degradative vacuoles. A previously undescribed type of autophagic vacuole was also identified having characteristics of both nascent and degradative vacuoles, but was different from lysosomes. This intermediate compartment contained only small amounts of cathepsin L in comparison to lysosomes and was bound by a double membrane, typical of nascent vacuoles. However, unlike nascent vacuoles vet comparable to degradative vacuoles, these vacuoles were acidic and contained the lysosomal membrane protein, lgp120, at the outer limiting membrane. The results were consistent with the stepwise acquisition of lysosomal membrane proteins and hydrolases. The presence of mannose-6-phosphate receptor in autophagic vacuoles suggested a possible role of this receptor in the delivery of newly synthesized hydrolases from the Golgi apparatus. However, tunicamycin had no significant effect on the amount of mature acid hydrolases present in a preparation of autophagic vacuoles isolated from a metrizamide gradient. Combined, the results suggested nascent autophagic vacuoles mature into degradative vacuoles in a stepwise fashion: (a) acquisition of lysosomal membrane proteins by fusing with a vesicle deficient in hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., prelysosome); (b) vacuole acidification; and (c) acquisition of hydrolases by fusing with preexisting lysosomes or Golgi apparatus-derived vesicles.", "pubdate_sims": "1990-06"}, "3972014": {"title": "Effect of amino acids and cycloheximide on changes caused by vinblastine, leupeptin and methylamine in the autophagic/lysosomal system of mouse hepatocytes in vivo.", "abstract": "The number of autophagic vacuoles in hepatocytes of 24 h fasted mice in vivo increased manyfold following the administration of vinblastine, leupeptin and methylamine.

These observations have permitted us to assign the vpt mutants to three distinct classes.

Consistent with a potential role for vacuolar pH in protein sorting, we found that bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase, as well as the weak base ammonium acetate and the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, collapse the pH gradient across the vacuolar membrane and cause the missorting and secretion of two vacuolar hydrolases in wild-type cells.

The regression of autophagic vacuoles was slow in mice pretreated with vinblastine (t1/2 of about 27-30 min) suggesting that this drug slows down the turnover of autophagic vacuoles. Morphometric evaluation of the regression of the autophagic vacuole compartment after cycloheximide treatment can be used as a tool to distinguish between treatments which elevate the amount of autophagic vacuoles within the cells by increasing the rate of sequestration from those which expand the autophagic vacuole compartment by causing accumulation of autophagic vacuoles as a result of blockade of the late steps of the autophagic process.", "pubdate_sims": "1987"}, "1683722": {"title": "Proteolysis in isolated autophagic vacuoles from the rat pancreas.

The maximum number of AVs was observed after 3 h of chloroquine treatment. The effect lasted for 12 h and almost disappeared after 16 h. The increase in AVs caused by chloroquine made it possible to isolate them in a discontinuous Metrizamide gradient with high purity. The proteolytic capacity of the AVs isolated after different chloroquine exposure times was measured after prelabeling pancreatic proteins with an injection of L-(1-14C)leucine 16 h before sacrifice. Protein degradation in isolated AVs increased during the first 6 h of chloroquine exposure and then returned to control values 16 h after the administration. In addition, the activities of two lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase and cathepsin B, increased in the AV-fractions following chloroquine treatment.

Yeast strains bearing a deletion of the VPS3 gene (vps3-delta 1) are viable, yet their growth rate is significantly reduced relative to wild-type cells. Temperature shift experiments with strains carrying a temperature conditional vps3 allele demonstrate that cells rapidly lose the capacity to sort the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y upon loss of VPS3 function. Vacuolar morphology was examined in wild-type and vps3-delta 1 yeast strains by fluorescence microscopy. The vacuoles in wild-type yeast cells are morphologically complex, and they appear to be actively partitioned between mother cells and buds during an early phase of bud growth. Vacuolar morphology in vps3-delta 1 mutants is significantly altered from the wild-type pattern, and the vacuolar segregation process seen in wild-type strains is defective in these mutants. With the exception of a vacuolar acidification defect, the phenotypes of vps3-delta 1 strains are significantly different from those of mutants lacking the vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase. These data demonstrate that the acidification defect in vps3-delta 1 cells is not the primary cause of the pleiotropic defects in vacuolar function observed in these mutants.", "pubdate_sims": "1990-09"}, "2307216": {"title": "Effects of vinblastine, leucine, and histidine, and 3-methyladenine on autophagy in Ehrlich ascites cells.", "abstract": "The microtubule inhibitor vinblastine causes accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in many cell types. In hepatocytes, many of the accumulated vacuoles are nascent, which has been interpreted to suggest that vinblastine acts by inhibiting the fusion of hydrolase-containing lysosomes with early autophagic vacuoles. However, our previous results suggested that, in Ehrlich ascites cells, vinblastine causes accumulation mainly of older autophagic vacuoles (AVs). This study was undertaken to further characterize the mode of action of vinblastine in these cells. The vinblastine-accumulated AVs were quantified by electron-microscopic morphometry. In addition, the effects of inhibitors of autophagic segregation (leucine, histidine, and 3-methyladenine) on the vinblastine-induced accumulation of autophagic vacuoles were studied. Protein degradation was measured using [14C]valine. Vinblastine caused accumulation of advanced autophagic vacuoles but did not increase the rate of protein degradation. The volume density of early vacuoles remained at the control level. The amino acids retarded but did not prevent the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, whereas 3-methyladenine almost completely prevented the accumulation. The results suggest that in Ehrlich ascites cells vinblastine acts by inhibiting the maturation of advanced autophagic vacuoles into residual bodies and by stimulating the formation of new autophagic vacuoles. However, 3-methyladenine almost completely prevents the formation of new autophagic vacuoles in the presence of vinblastine. In conclusion, in Ehrlich ascites cells, vinblastine does not prevent the entry of hydrolases into autophagic vacuoles.

This increase was due to the significant increase in their number, which was approximately 5-fold 4 h, 12 h and 24 h after vinblastine injection. The mean volume of the autophagic vacuoles increased significantly 1 h after vinblastine injection, at which time the formation of new autophagic vacuoles was at its greatest. There was an accumulation of single membrane-limited, obviously older autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm. Their volume density was at its maximum 12 h after injection, suggesting a retarded turnover of autophagic vacuoles. The segregation of cytoplasmic components into autophagic vacuoles may not be selective after vinblastine injection. The injurious effects of vinblastine were evident both in light and electron microscopic studies. In the parenchymal cells the Golgi cisternae were dilated and disorganized and the volume density of the Golgi apparatus was significantly decreased 12 h after vinblastine injection.

Vacuole formation was dose and time dependent between 2 X 10(-4) M and 10(-3) M. By light microscopy, morphologic alterations induced by the drug were clear cytoplasmic vacuoles in live cells, vacuoles in dead cells and dead cells without vacuoles. Small round vacuoles were an early change. Dark granules were dispersed among the vacuoles. The vacuoles increased in size at higher doses or longer times. Eventually all the cytoplasm was occupied by vacuoles and the cells were enlarged. By electron microscopy, the vacuoles were round, primarily membrane-bound, contained mostly electron-lucent material and occasionally small flocculent bodies. There was vacuolar coalescence. The dose response of vacuole induction in confluent and semiconfluent cells was similar. Cytoplasmic vacuoles without cell death can be induced by disobutamide at 2 or 4 X 10(-4) M during a 3-day exposure.

Neither the use of carbohydrates other than glucose to prevent development of respiration-deficient mutants, nor treatment with acriflavine to render all surviving wild types respiration-deficient, provided a selective advantage for the auxotrophs. Increased concentrations of the antifungal agents amphotericin B or endomycin, while reducing the number of respiration-deficient mutants, did not significantly increase the final mutant-wild type ratio. A more soluble form of amphotericin B (Fungizone), when used under carefully defined physiological conditions, produced a significant reduction in the number of surviving prototrophs relative to the surviving auxotrophs, without development of respiration-deficient mutants.", "pubdate_sims": "1966-08"}, "14080807": {"title": "NONSPORULATING, RESPIRATION-DEFICIENT VARIANTS OF SACCHAROMYCES PASTORIANUS INDUCED BY CYCLOHEXIMIDE.", "abstract": "Lomander, L.

The primary colony organisms were slow-growing and cycloheximide-resistant as compared with the secondary ones which, like the parent organisms, were fast-growing in the absence of cycloheximide, but were inhibited when cycloheximide was incorporated in the medium. Cell aggregates, large swollen cells, and dwarf cells were found among the secondary colony organisms. The primary colony organisms were smaller than normal cells but were larger than the dwarf cells. The primary colony organisms also proved to have lost the faculty to sporulate, whereas the secondary colony organisms sporulated like the untreated parents. In contrast to the normal organisms and the secondary colony organisms, the primary colony organisms did not consume oxygen in manometric experiments with glucose as a substrate.

The possibility of their resumption of development to mature worms in the late summer and autumn period is discussed. Adult T. axei showed a similar seasonal trend to Ostertagia and may have increased the severity of outbreaks of clinical disease. Cooperia populations of EL4 and adult worms were highest in weaners during winter, but lower numbers thereafter indicated a strong resistance to re-infection.

The first of these has to do with how the complex, abstract properties exhibited by these cells can be explained mechanistically. The second has to do with the implications of place cells for our conception of the broader role of the hippocampus in spatial and other behaviors. Here, evidence is reviewed that: (1) Hippocampal cells show different \"maps\" (place cell representations) for each environment the animal visits and, in fact, can show multiple maps even for any one environment. The choice of the current map for any one environment depends on environmental, contextual, and event-related variables. (2) Cells in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex also show location-specific firing patterns (like hippocampal place cells), but show the same pattern for each environment the animal visits. A model is presented that is a variant of hippocampus-based path integration models developed by McNaughton and colleagues. In this version, the subiculum and entorhinal cortex work together to form a single, universal map that is used for each environment, and that can exhibit path integration abilities. The universal subicular/entorhinal representation is postulated to assist the hippocampal layer to rapidly form new environment and context specific \"maps\" for each new environment/temporal context (\"episode\") the animal experiences. In this view, hippocampal layer activity is always obligatorily spatial, due to the input from the entorhinal universal \"map.\" However, the fact that the hippocampus generates a new map in response to global, non-spatial, contextual attributes of each situation, means that the hippocampus is always coding non-spatial aspects of a situation using its obligatorily spatial code.

Second, cells in deep layers of the EC, the targets of hippocampal outputs, appeared to represent the similarities between locations on spatially distinct trajectories through the environment.

However, almost 30 years since place cells were found in rodent hippocampal field CA1, it is still unclear how such an allocentric representation arises from an ego-centrically perceived world. By means of a competitive Hebbian learning rule responsible for coding visual and path integration cues, our model is able to explain the diversity of place cell responses observed in a large set of electrophysiological experiments with a single fixed set of parameters. Experiments included changes observed in place fields due to exploration of a new environment, darkness, retrosplenial cortex inactivation, and removal, rotation, and permutation of landmarks. To code for visual cues for each landmark, we defined two perceptual schemas representing landmark bearing and distance information over a linear array of cells. The information conveyed by the perceptual schemas is further processed through a network of adaptive layers which ultimately modulate the resulting activity of our simulated place cells. In path integration terms, our system is able to dynamically remap a bump of activity coding for the displacement of the animal in relation to an environmental anchor. We hypothesize that path integration information is computed in the rodent posterior parietal cortex and conveyed to the hippocampus where, together with visual information, it modulates place cell activity. The resulting network yields a more direct treatment of partial remapping of place fields than other models. In so doing, it makes new predictions regarding the nature of the interaction between visual and path integration cues during new learning and when the system is challenged with environmental changes.", "pubdate_sims": "2001"}, "11802918": {"title": "Measuring information spatial densities.", "abstract": "A novel definition of the stimulus-specific information is presented, which is particularly useful when the stimuli constitute a continuous and metric set, as, for example, position in space.

These place cells derive their specificity from a multitude of sources, including idiothetic cues and sensory input derived from both distal and local landmarks. Most experiments have attempted to dissociate the relative strengths and roles played by these sources by rotating one set against the other. Few studies have addressed the effects of relative translation of the local cue set versus salient distal landmarks. To address this question, ensembles of place cells were recorded as a rectangular or circular track was moved to different locations in a room with controlled visual landmarks. Place cells primarily maintained their firing fields relative to the track (i.e., occupying new locations relative to the distal landmarks), even though the track could occupy completely nonoverlapping regions of the room. When the distal landmarks were rotated around the circular track, however, the place fields rotated with the landmarks, demonstrating that the cues were perceptible to the rat. These results suggest that, under these conditions, the spatial tuning of place cells may derive from an interaction between local and idiothetic cues, which define the precise firing locations of the cells and the relationships between them, and distal landmarks, which set the orientation of the ensemble representation relative to the external environment.", "pubdate_sims": "2003"}, "12959664": {"title": "Is there something out there?

We review the current literature on path integration and its interaction with external, location-based cues.

Both entorhinal cortex lesions and retrosplenial cortex lesions elicited a deficit in the rat's reaction to a spatial change. In addition, rats with entorhinal lesions showed hypoactive object exploration and exhibited a mild deficit in reaction to a non-spatial change.

The tortuosity of a random search path controls the local searching intensity, allowing the animal to adjust its search effort to the local profitability of the environment. This paper shows that (1) the efficiency of an oriented path can be reliably estimated by a straightness index computed as the ratio between the distance from the starting point to the goal and the path length travelled to reach the goal, but such a simple index, ranging between 0 and 1, cannot be applied to random search paths; (2) the tortuosity of a random search path, ranging between straight line movement and Brownian motion, can be reliably estimated by a sinuosity index which combines the mean cosine of changes of direction with the mean step length; and (3) in the current state of the art, the fractal analysis of animals' paths, which may appear as an alternative and promising way to measure the tortuosity of a random search path as a fractal dimension ranging between 1 (straight line movement) and 2 (Brownian motion), is only liable to generate artifactual results.

Associative learning of different types and the related pattern encoding-recognition take place at three successive levels: (1) an object location level, which computes the landmarks from merged multimodal sensory inputs in the parahippocampal cortices; (2) a subject location level, which computes place fields by combination of local views and movement-related information in the entorhinal cortex; and (3) a spatiotemporal level, which computes place transitions from contiguous place fields in the CA3-CA1 region, which form building blocks for learning temporospatial sequences. At the cell population level, superficial entorhinal place cells encode spatial, context-independent maps as landscapes of activity; populations of transition cells in the CA3-CA1 region encode context-dependent maps as sequences of transitions, which form graphs in prefrontal-parietal cortices. The model was tested on a robot moving in a real environment; these tests produced results that could help to interpret biological data. Two different goal-oriented navigation strategies were displayed depending on the type of map used by the system. Thanks to its multilevel, multimodal integration and behavioral implementation, the model suggests functional interpretations for largely unaccounted structural differences between hippocampo-cortical systems.

After separation of the protein and lipid components of synaptic vesicles under nondenaturing conditions, synapsin I bound to both components. The use of hydrophobic labeling procedures allowed the assessment of interactions between phospholipids and synapsin I in intact synaptic vesicles. Hydrophobic photolabeling followed by cysteine-specific cleavage of synapsin I demonstrated that the head domain of synapsin I penetrates into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. The purified NH2-terminal fragment, derived from the head domain by cysteine-specific cleavage, bound to synaptic vesicles with high affinity confirming the results obtained from hydrophobic photolabeling. Synapsin I binding to synaptic vesicles could be inhibited by the entire molecule or by the combined presence of the NH2-terminal and tail fragments, but not by an excess of either NH2-terminal or tail fragment alone. The purified tail fragment bound with relatively high affinity to synaptic vesicles, though it did not significantly interact with phospholipids. Binding of the tail fragment was competed by holosynapsin I; was greatly decreased by phosphorylation; and was abolished by high ionic strength conditions or protease treatment of synaptic vesicles. The data suggest the existence of two sites of interaction between synapsin I and small synaptic vesicles: binding of the head domain to vesicle phospholipids and of the tail domain to a protein component of the vesicle membrane.

Null mutations in synaptotagmin have been made in Drosophila, and the protein's in vivo function has been assayed at the neuromuscular synapse. In the absence of synaptotagmin, synaptic transmission is dramatically impaired but is not abolished. In null mutants, evoked vesicle release is decreased by a factor of 10. Moreover, the fidelity of excitation-secretion coupling is impaired so that a given stimulus generates a more variable amount of secretion. However, this residual evoked release shows Ca(2+)-dependence similar to normal release, suggesting either that synaptotagmin is not the Ca2+ sensor or that a second, independent Ca2+ sensor exists. While evoked transmission is suppressed, the rate of spontaneous vesicle fusion is increased by a factor of 5. We conclude that synaptotagmin is not an absolutely essential component of the Ca(2+)-dependent secretion pathway in synaptic transmission but is necessary for normal levels of transmission.

Numerous experiments have shown that the protein, or protein complex, binds multiple Ca2+ ions, resides near the site of Ca2+ influx, and has a relatively low affinity for Ca2+. Synaptotagmin is an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles that contains two copies of a domain known to be involved in Ca(2+)-dependent membrane interactions. Synaptotagmin has been shown to bind Ca2+ in vitro with a relatively low affinity. In addition, synaptotagmin has been shown to bind indirectly to Ca2+ channels, positioning the protein close to the site of Ca2+ influx. Recently, a negative regulatory role for synaptotagmin has been proposed, in which it functions as a clamp to prevent fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Release of the clamp would allow exocytosis. Here we present genetic and electrophysiological evidence that synaptotagmin forms a multimeric complex that can function as a clamp in vivo. However, upon nerve stimulation and Ca2+ influx, all synaptotagmin mutations dramatically decrease the ability of Ca2+ to promote release, suggesting that synaptotagmin probably plays a key role in activation of synaptic vesicle fusion. This activity cannot simply be attributed to the removal of a barrier to secretion, as we can electrophysiologically separate the increase in rate of spontaneous vesicle fusion from the decrease in evoked response. We also find that some syt mutations, including those that lack the second Ca(2+)-binding domain, decrease the fourth-order dependence of release on Ca2+ by approximately half, consistent with the hypothesis that a synaptotagmin complex functions as a Ca2+ receptor for initiating exocytosis.", "pubdate_sims": "1994-11-08"}, "7909234": {"title": "The effect on synaptic physiology of synaptotagmin mutations in Drosophila.", "abstract": "Synaptotagmin is a synaptic vesicle protein implicated in neurotransmitter release.

Decreased neurotransmitter release caused smaller evoked synaptic potentials. However, the frequency, but not the size, of spontaneous quantal events was simultaneously increased. These abnormalities do not appear to be secondary to a detectable morphological change in the arborization of the synapse. The increased frequency of spontaneous events was insufficient to deplete significantly the vesicle supply and thereby account for reduced transmission.

We find that injection of peptides from the C2 domains of synaptotagmin into squid giant presynaptic terminals rapidly and reversibly inhibits neurotransmitter release.

In the most highly conserved C2 domain, the mammalian synaptotagmins, SYT1 and SYT2, share 88% sequence identity, whereas SYT3 has only approximately 45% identity to either. Overall, SYT3 has the greatest sequence identity with rat SYT2 and marine ray p65A (both 37%), although homology to all of the known synaptotagmins is > 30%. However, SYT3 is most like p65C when comparing domain structure. Syt3 is expressed in many regions of the nervous system but is undetectable in extraneural tissues. The three murine synaptotagmins have differential expression patterns in the brain. Furthermore, in PC12 cells, Syt3 is coexpressed with Syt1 and is more abundant than the latter.

Electrophysiological recordings in embryonic cultures confirmed that synaptic transmission persists in the null allele.

On the other hand, the fractions containing the M(r) 160,000-220,000 and 29,000 polypeptides bound alpha-latrotoxin with high affinity. Sucrose gradient centrifugations and anion exchange chromatography suggested that most of the M(r) 160,000-220,000 proteins were complexed with the M(r) 29,000 protein. alpha-Latrotoxin binding correlated with the presence of the M(r) 160,000-220,000 proteins and M(r) 29,000 polypeptide, and alpha-latrotoxin formed stable complexes with the M(r) 160,000-220,000 proteins.

Accumulation of GAP-43 persists, however, in a minority of mature synaptic terminals. What properties of axons and their terminals are affected by these changes in GAP-43 expression? Storm and colleagues first noted that the membrane- and calmodulin-binding properties of GAP-43 (a.k.a. P-57 or neuromodulin) could allow it to sequester a large fraction of calmodulin to the submembranous regions, and to release free calmodulin in response to protein kinase C activation. Analysis of evolutionarily conserved sequences in GAP-43 indicates that these properties are central to the biological effects of the protein. If GAP-43 is presumed to inactivate bound calmodulin, the network of GAP-43 in an axon terminal could be considered a regulatable calmodulin buffer, or 'calmodulin sponge', absorbing free calmodulin and releasing it in response to activation of protein kinase C. Such a calmodulin sponge has properties that could be useful in modulating the responses of membrane and cytoskeletal assembly events to calcium signals in growth cones, and in mediating long-term potentiation of neurotransmitter release from some pre-synaptic terminals.", "pubdate_sims": "1990"}, "1686727": {"title": "Concurrent inactivation of calcium dependent phosphorylation and neurotransmitter release in cultured rat brain neurons.", "abstract": "Depolarization of cultured rat brain neurons preloaded with 3H-dopamine provokes a transient (t 1/2 = 9.6 sec), Ca(2+)-dependent release of the labeled neurotransmitter from cells.

The depolarization-evoked changes in the neuronal protein phosphorylation were dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (half saturation at 0.4-0.5 mM Ca2+).

Using laser-scanning confocal microscopy and digital image analysis, we have used this chimaera to monitor the effects of secretagogues on the dynamics of secretory granules in single living cells. In unstimulated INS-1 beta-cells, granule movement was confined to oscillatory movement (dithering) with period of oscillation 5-10 s and mean displacement <1 microm. Both elevated glucose concentrations (30 mM), and depolarization of the plasma membrane with K+, provoked large (5-10 microm) saltatory excursions of granules across the cell, which were never observed in cells maintained at low glucose concentration. By contrast, long excursions of granules occurred in PC12 cells without stimulation, and occurred predominantly from the cell body towards the cell periphery and neurite extensions. Purinergic-receptor activation with ATP provoked granule movement towards the membrane of PC12 cells, resulting in the transfer of fluorescence to the plasma membrane consistent with fusion of the granule and diffusion of the chimaera in the plasma membrane.

Electrical field-evoked exocytosis of D-[3H]aspartate was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 but not by methylamine, indicating that a transvesicular membrane potential rather than pH gradient is required for transmitter retention within vesicles. In contrast, neither compound affected the field-evoked uptake, recycling, or destaining of the vesicle-specific dye FM2-10; thus, vesicles whose lumens were neutral and/or depleted of transmitter could still recycle in the nerve terminal. No exhaustion of D-[3H]aspartate exocytosis was observed when cells were subjected to six consecutive trains of field stimuli (40 Hz/10 s separated by 10 s). In contrast, the release of preloaded FM2-10 was reduced by approximately 50%, with each stimulus indicating that unlabeled vesicles with accumulated D-[3H]aspartate were competing with labeled vesicles for exocytosis. As D-[3H]aspartate was accumulated rapidly across the vesicle membrane from the large cytoplasmic pool, the transmitter-loaded but unlabelled vesicles may represent refilled recycling vesicles. FM2-10 destaining and D-[3H]aspartate exocytosis were reduced in parallel at low frequencies, challenging a role for transient vesicle fusion.", "pubdate_sims": "1997-11"}, "8257604": {"title": "Biogenesis of constitutive secretory vesicles, secretory granules and synaptic vesicles.", "abstract": "The formation of constitutive secretory vesicles and secretory granules from the trans-Golgi network is inhibited by brefeldin A, suggesting a role for ADP ribosylation factor and other coat proteins in the budding process, and is regulated by multiple heterotrimeric G proteins.

Attempts are underway to link the small number of membrane proteins to the small number of functions the vesicles perform. The discovery of sequence homologies has helped greatly with this. In addition, techniques that have begun to prove successful involve microinjection, identification of proteins that bind synaptic vesicle proteins, DNA transfection into cells and oocytes, and more recently, in vitro reconstitution of exocytosis, endocytosis, and vesicle biogenesis. Advances in the latter areas have been strongly influenced by the breakthroughs in our knowledge of membrane traffic in nonneuronal cells. The budding reactions involved in making synaptic vesicles and secretory granules resemble in many ways the generation of carrier vesicles from the ER and the Golgi complex. Finally, exocytosis in neurons may closely resemble fusion of carrier vesicles with target organelles in nonneuronal cells, using complexes of peripheral membrane proteins, GTP hydrolysis, and integral membrane proteins with fusogenic domains. The usefulness of in vitro reconstitution, reverse genetics, and the parallels with better understood systems compensates in part for a major weakness in the field, namely the difficulty in obtaining viable mutants that are defective in the storage and release of secretory vesicle content.", "pubdate_sims": "1993-01"}, "1655810": {"title": "Association of Rab3A with synaptic vesicles at late stages of the secretory pathway.", "abstract": "Rab3A is a small GTP-binding protein highly concentrated on synaptic vesicles.

To determine at which stage of the life cycle of synaptic vesicles rab3A is associated with their membranes, the localization of the protein in neurons and neuroendocrine cells at different developmental and functional stages was investigated. In all cases, rab3A was colocalized with synaptic vesicle markers at the cell periphery, but was absent from the Golgi area, suggesting that rab3A associates with vesicles distally to the Golgi complex and dissociates from vesicle membranes before they recycle to this region. Immunofluorescence experiments carried out on frog motor end plates demonstrated that massive exocytosis of synaptic vesicles is accompanied by a translocation of rab3A to the cell surface. The selective localization of rab3A on synaptic vesicles at stages preceding their fusion with the plasmalemma suggests that the protein is part of a regulatory machinery that is assembled onto the vesicles in preparation for exocytosis.", "pubdate_sims": "1991-11"}, "8938128": {"title": "A role of intracellular Na+ in the regulation of synaptic transmission and turnover of the vesicular pool in cultured hippocampal cells.", "abstract": "Propagation of action potentials in axons and dendrites increases intracellular Na+ ([Na+]i) and Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i).

An elevation of [Na+]i and a concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i, led to a large increase in sEPSC frequency and in the turnover of the presynaptic vesicular pool.

Furthermore, a linear DNA molecule such as that of a eukaryotic chromosome must have a structure at its ends which allows its complete replication, as no known DNA polymerase can initiate synthesis without a primer. At the ends of the relatively short, multi-copy linear DNA molecules found naturally in the nuclei of several lower eukaryotes, there are simple tandemly repeated sequences with, in the cases analysed, a specific array of single-strand breaks, on both DNA strands, in the distal portion of the block of repeats.

The fact that yeast can recognize and use DNA ends from the distantly related organism Tetrahymena suggests that the structural features required for telomere replication and resolution have been highly conserved in evolution. The linear plasmid was used as a vector to clone chromosomal telomeres from yeast. One Tetrahymena end was removed by restriction digestion, and yeast fragments that could function as an end on a linear plasmid were selected. Restriction mapping and hybridization analysis demonstrated that these fragments were yeast telomeres, and suggested that all yeast chromosomes might have a common telomere sequence. Yeast telomeres appear to be similar in structure to the rDNA of Tetrahymena, in which specific nicks or gaps are present within a simple repeated sequence near the terminus of the DNA.", "pubdate_sims": "1982-05"}, "6950385": {"title": "Repeated hexanucleotide C-C-C-C-A-A is present near free ends of macronuclear DNA of Tetrahymena.", "abstract": "The tandemly repeated hexanucleotide C-C-C-C-A-A has previously been found near the termini of extrachromosomal gene coding for ribosomal RNA as well as in many other locations of the genome of Tetrahymena.

In this study we used the exonuclease Bal 31 to show that the repeats are located near free ends of DNA in the macronucleus. When whole cell DNA or macronuclear DNA was digested with Bal 31 to remove approximately 600 base pairs from free ends, 80% of the C4A2 repeats were removed, as judged by hybridization.

This study investigates the fate of the sequences adjacent to the micronuclear C4A2 repeats. Southern blot analyses of 21 C4A2-containing micronuclear clones show that extensive elimination of the adjacent sequences occurs during the formation of the macronucleus. Comparison of one C4A2-containing micronuclear clone with its derived macronuclear segment indicates that approximately 4.5 kb of DNA, which includes the C4A2 repeats and adjacent sequences on both sides is deleted from the macronucleus. The two regions adjoining the deletion are joined together to form a contiguous segment in the macronucleus.

In particular peptide coding, intervening segments, structural RNA coding and mitochondrial domains of the vertebrate genome are uniquely characterizable. The statistical measures not only reflect understood functional differences among these domains but suggest others.

Analysis of mouse constant domain immunoglobulin sequences revealed self-complementary regions that can be used to fold the molecule into a structure consistent with electron microscopic observations. Computer translation of nucleic acid sequences into all possible amino acid sequences followed by graphic matrix analysis provides a way to detect the most likely protein encoding regions and can predict the correct reading frames in sequences in which splicing patterns are not defined. Application of this technique to regions of simian virus 40 and polyoma virus demonstrates the frames of translation and shows the agreement of sequences determined in separate laboratories with different virus isolates.

The relationship is valid for transcribed or nontranscribed DNA and for DNA that contains only coding sequences. Length differences in the fetal globin duplicated regions correlate positively with the occurrence of short direct repeats of greater than or equal 5 base pairs. Path analysis of the interrelationships of base composition, base substitutions, repeats and length differences provides an integrated view of the relative effects on chromosomal changes of these variables and of selection. The distributions along the chromosome of simple sequences and of base compositions show highly significant local asymmetries between the transcribed and nontranscribed strands of the DNA, which permit us to divide the fetal globin gene region into chromosomal domains.

When a cDNA transcript of the poly(A)+ mRNA from 2 hr zygotes is reacted against poly(A)+ RNA from either eggs or zygotes, the kinetics of reassociation of the two preparations seem identical; hence the RNA sequences bearing poly(A) are the same in eggs and zygotes.

In marked contrast, membranes prepared from eggs of A. punctulata quantitatively inhibit fertilization of A. punctulata eggs by A. punctulata sperm. Several lines of evidence indicate that this inhibition is due to the presence of a membrane-associated glycoprotein that binds to the sperm, thus preventing them from interacting with receptor on the surface of the eggs. First, eggs treated with trypsin are incapable of being fertilized, although they can be activated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Moreover, membranes prepared from eggs pretreated with trypsin do not inhibit fertilization of eggs. Second, receptor isolated in soluble form from surface membranes binds to sperm and thus prevents them from fertilizing eggs; the inhibition by soluble receptor is species-specific.

Upon entering mitosis, treated eggs form functional spindles that are reduced in length and birefringent retardation but not width. With increased exposure to Colcemid, the length and retardation of the metaphase spindles are progressively reduced. Similar results are obtained by pulsing the eggs with Colcemid before fertilization, which demonstrates that the tubulin found in unfertilized sea urchin eggs is later used in spindle formation. Spindles, once assembled, are responsive to increases in the amount of polymerizable tubulin within the cell. Rapid increases in the amount of polymerizable tubulin within a Colcemid-treated cell can be experimentally effected by irradiating the cells with 366-nm light. This treatment photochemically inactivates the Colcemid, thereby freeing the tubulin to polymerize. Upon irradiation, the small prometaphase spindles of Colcemid-treated cells immediately increase in length and retardation. In these irradiated cells, spindle length and retardation increase as much as four times faster than they do during prometaphase for normal spindles.

Assuming that the narcotic acts upon a single catalyst in the unfertilized egg the degree to which the consumption of oxygen is inhibited in this resting cell can be related to the narcotic concentration by an expression derived from the law of mass action. 2. To account for the relation between the concentration of the narcotic and its effect on respiration in the fertilized eggs, it is necessary to conclude that in them the narcotic acts on two parallel respiratory systems. The experimental data can be quantitatively predicted (1) if the reaction of the narcotic on the two systems is governed by the law of mass action and (2) if 40 per cent of the oxygen consumption is mediated by one system, the \"activity\" system, and the remainder by the other, the \"resting\" or \"basal\" system. 3. The mass law constants applying to the resting system in the fertilized egg are similar to those for the single system functioning in the unfertilized egg so that these two respiratory systems are probably identical. 4.

In comparison with the normal eggs (uninhibited, non-caffeine-treated controls), caffeine in concentrations including and greater than 0.1 per cent (M/200) depressed the average uptake from approximately 25 to 61 per cent over the 3 hour period. In a number of instances, as typified by Experiment 10, the effective inhibitory concentration ranged from 0.02 per cent (M/1,000) upward and the degree of depression of the O(2) consumption ranged from 10.6 per cent to 60.6 per cent. 3. All caffeine concentrations including and above 0.02 per cent (M/1,000) in the series used, resulted in decreasing the normal rate of cleavage division in the fertilized Arbacia eggs. 4. The higher concentrations (0.5 and 2 per cent) produced a complete blockage of the cleavage process. 5. Complete cleavage inhibition was noted only when the O(2) uptake had been depressed to 50 per cent or more of the normal controls. 6. O(2) consumption-time relationship data indicate an average depression, in O(2) consumption over a 3 hour period, ranging from 25 per cent with a caffeine concentration of 0.1 per cent to a 61 per cent inhibition with a concentration of 2 per cent. 7. Concentrations of less than 0.1 per cent (certainly of less than 0.02 per cent) give variable results and indicate no significant effect. 8. It is inferred from the respiration data presented that it is probable that the inhibition of the O(2) consumption in fertilized Arbacia eggs is due to the influence of caffeine upon the main (activity or primary) pathway. It will be observed that there are certain similarities of the caffeine data to the degree of inhibition accomplished by sodium cyanide. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the cyanide probably acts on the cytochrome oxidase step in the cytochrome oxidase-cytochrome chain of reactions constituting the O(2) uptake phase of respiratory metabolism. It is not improbable, therefore, that caffeine also may act upon the cytochrome oxidase enzyme. 9.

From this point cleavage becomes progressively slower with further dilution. Many eggs fail to cleave at dilutions of 5 to 6 volumes per cent. No cleavage occurs in 2 volumes per cent sea water or in pure sugar solution. Eggs returned from these media to sea water resume cleavage and development. There is thus no relation between the rate of cleavage and the electrical conductivity of the medium, except possibly within the range of dilutions from 20 to 5 volumes per cent sea water. In this range cleavage rate decreases as conductivity decreases, but the relation is not a linear one.", "pubdate_sims": "1923-07-20"}, "19873309": {"title": "STUDIES ON CELL METABOLISM AND CELL DIVISION : VII.

Methods suitable for the determination of diphosphothiamine (cocarboxylase) in eggs of Arbacia punctulata have been developed. Quantitative extraction of the cocarboxylase was effected by combining the use of thiamine hydrochloride in the extraction fluid with critical adjustment of the pH of extraction to pH 6.3-6.7. 2. The unfertilized eggs were found to contain the equivalent of 2 to 3 micrograms of natural yeast cocarboxylase per gm. of wet eggs; the cocarboxylase content of the 30 minute and 10 hour fertilized eggs was somewhat less (Table III). 3. In preliminary experiments, Arbacia egg cytolysates were found to cause pyruvic acid to disappear. The rate of such disappearance was apparently greater under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions; it was also greater for cytolysates from fertilized eggs than for cytolysates from unfertilized eggs (Table IV).", "pubdate_sims": "1942-05-20"}, "19872441": {"title": "THE EFFECT OF CERTAIN ELECTROLYTES AND NON-ELECTROLYTES ON PERMEABILITY OF LIVING CELLS TO WATER.", "abstract": "1.

The withdrawal responses are controlled by five identified motor cells which receive two types of synaptic inputs. One set of excitatory connections, activated by tactile stimulation of the siphon and mantle shelf, mediates the defensive withdrawal reflex. A second set of connections is activated by a spontaneous burst of activity in a group of closely coupled interneurons which are excitatory to some of the motor cells and inhibitory to the others.

Since puromycin-dependent ribosome release only occurs at high ionic strength, it appears that ribosomes are bound to membranes via two types of interactions: a direct one between the membrane and the large ribosomal subunit (labile at high KCl concentration) and an indirect one in which the nascent chain anchors the ribosome to the membrane (puromycin labile). The nascent chains of ribosomes specifically released by puromycin remain tightly associated with the stripped membranes. Some membrane-bound ribosomes (up to 40%) can be nondestructively released in high ionic strength media without puromycin; these appear to consist of a mixture of inactive ribosomes and ribosomes containing relatively short nascent chains.

Attachment of ribosomes to the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria.", "abstract": "Growing yeast spheroplasts were shown to have, on the average, four times the number of cytoplasmic ribosomes in contact with the outer mitochondrial membrane compared to starved spheroplasts. Ribosomes in contact with mitochondria in the growing spheroplast preparation, like free cytoplasmic ribosomes, exist primarily as polysome structures. In the starved spheroplast preparation, both mitochondria-bound and free cytoplasmic ribosomes exist primarily as monosomes. Mitochondria isolated from growing spheroplasts in a medium containing lmM Mg++ have cytoplasmic ribosomes bound directly to the outer membrane. These ribosomes can be quantitatively removed by washing the mitochondria with 2 mM EDTA. Mitochondria from starved spheroplasts are capable of accepting either free cytoplasmic polysomes or cytoplasmic polysomes extracted from mitochondria. However, the extent of polysome binding to mitochondria was shown to be a direct function of the Mg++ concentration; a smaller percentage of the input polysomes bind as the Mg++ concentration is lowered. At 1 mM Mg++, neither free cytoplasmic nor mitochondria-bound polysomes bind to mitochondria. Nevertheless, when growing spheroplasts are broken and mitochondria isolated in medium containing 1 mM Mg++, the mitochondria are seen to have cytoplasmic ribosomes firmly attached to the outer membrane. This result, in addition to our earlier data (Kellems, R. E., and R. A. Butow. 1974. J. Biol. Chem. 249:3304-3310), support the view that cytoplasmic ribosomes attached to the outer membrane of purified mitochondria were attached in vivo. In preparations of mitochondria isolated from growing spheroplasts, ribosomes appear to be found to specific regions of the outer membrane, namely those regions which are in close association or in contact with the inner mitochondrial membrane. This is particularly evident with mitochondria in a condensed configuration.

Although ribosomes and subunits are not extensively degraded into smaller fragments during low temperature proteolysis, changes in the acrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern showed that most ribosomal proteins are accessible to and are partially degraded by the proteases. Ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides are partially resistant to proteolysis at 0 degrees , although they are totally digested at 37 degrees or when the ribosomal subunit structure is disrupted by other means. Radioactivity incorporated into nascent chains during incubation times shorter than 3 min was mostly resistant to digestion at 0 degrees . A larger fraction of the initial radioactivity became degraded in ribosomes which incorporated for longer times. In these ribosomes, the amount of radioactivity which was resistant to proteolysis was constant and independent of the initial value, which reflects the labeled length of the nascent chains. These results suggest that the growing end of the nascent polypeptide is resistant to digestion and is protected from proteolytic attack by the ribosomal structure. A pulse and chase experiment confirmed this suggestion, showing that the protected segment is located at the carboxy-terminal end of the nascent chain.

In adult frogs and toads, and in larvae approaching metamorphosis, belts of membrane fusion or zonulae occludentes of considerable depth are regularly found between adjoining cells of the outermost layer of the stratum corneum, binding the cells together into a continuous, uninterrupted sheet. Another set of occluding zonules appears in the second cornified layer (when such a layer is present), and a third set usually occurs in the outermost layer of the stratum granulosum. Specialized elements described as \"modified\" and \"composite\" desmosomes are encountered along the lateral and basal aspects, respectively, of the cornified cells; ordinary desmosomes and maculae occludentes (i.e., spots of membrane fusion) are found in all other strata. The usual 200 A intercellular gap is generally maintained between the cells of the stratum germinativum at the basal ends of the intercellular spaces. Hence, the intercellular spaces of the epidermis form a largely continuous network, closed to the external medium and open to the dermal interstitia. The situation is comparable to that found in columnar epithelia, except that the intercellular spaces are much more extensive, and an extracellular subcompartment (or two) apparently exists in the stratum corneum and between the latter and the stratum granulosum. The last subcompartment is usually filled with a dense substance, probably derived from discharged secretory granules. The tripartite junctional complex characteristic of lumen-lining epithelia (i.e., a zonula occludens followed by a zonula adhaerens, and desmosome) is seen only in early larvae; in adults and in larvae approaching metamorphosis, the occluding zonule is followed directly by a series of modified desmosomes. Interpreted in the light of current physiological data, these findings suggest that the diffusion of water, ions, and small, water-soluble molecules is impeded along the intercellular spaces of the epidermis by zonulae occludentes while it is facilitated from cell to cell within the epidermis by zonulae and maculae occludentes.", "pubdate_sims": "1965-07"}, "5462173": {"title": "Differences in the ribosomal protein of free and membrane bound polysomes of chick embryo cells.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1970-04-24"}, "6034775": {"title": "Studies on free and membrane-bound ribosomes in rat liver.

Since after a 3-min pulse with [35S]methionine these membrane native subunits appear to contain at least sevenfold more Met-tRNA per particle than the free native subunits, they may all be initiation complexes with mRNA molecules which have just become associated with the membranes; (b) about 50% of the ribosomes present in polyribosomes. Evidence is presented that the released ribosomes carry nascent chains about two and a half to three times shorter than those present on the ribosomes remaining bound to the membranes. It is proposed that in the membrane-bound polyribosomes of P3K cells, only the ribosomes closer to the 3' end of the mRNA molecules are directly bound, while the latest ribosomes to enter the polyribosomal structures are indirectly bound through the mRNA molecules; (c) a small number of 40S subunits of polyribosomal origin, presumably initiation complexes attached at the 5' end of mRNA molecules of polyribosomes. When the P3K cells were incubated with inhibitors acting at different steps of protein synthesis, it was found that puromycin and pactamycin decreased by about 40% the proportion of ribosomes in the membrane fraction, while cycloheximide and anisomycin had no such effect. The ribosomes remaining on the membrane fraction of puromycin-treated cells consisted of a few polyribosomes, and of an accumulation of 80S and 60S particles, which were almost entirely released by high salt treatment of the membranes. The membrane-bound ribosomes found after pactamycin treatment consisted of a few polyribosomes, with a striking accumulation of native 60S subunits and an increased number of native 40S subunits. On the basis of the observations made in this and the preceding papers, a model for the binding of ribosomes to membranes and for the ribosomal cycle on the membranes is proposed. It is suggested that ribosomal subunits exchange between free and membrane-bound polyribosomes through the cytoplasmic pool of free native subunits, and that their entry into membrane-bound ribosomes is mediated by mRNA molecules associated with membranes.", "pubdate_sims": "1975-10"}, "4836386": {"title": "Changes in the ribosome content, principal microsomal protein composition, and secretory character of mammary epithelial rough endoplasmic reticulum during differentiation.

The density range exhibited by the rough microsomes broadens during mammary development; rough microsomes within the 1.25-1.29 g/ml density range appear soon after conception and then within the 1.30-1.34 range after the onset of lactation. The appearance of these denser microsomes represents the progressive increase of the average ribosome content of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during gestation and lactation. Fractionation of rough microsomal proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that two proteins, having molecular weights of 57,000 and 76,000, occur to a significant extent only during lactation and are then most prominent in the very dense rough microsomes of the 1.30-1.34 range. Nascent polypeptide chains discharged (by incubation with puromycin) from 17-days lactation rough microsomes in either the 1.21-1.29 or 1.30-1.34 density range are distributed equally between the intra- and extravesicular compartments. Whereas 36% of the chains are discharged intravesicularly from 1-day lactation rough microsomes in the 1.30-1.34 range, only 25% are so discharged from those in the 1.21-1.29 range. The results indicate (a) that there is no correlation between the relative levels in lactation rough microsomes of the two microsomal proteins which become prominent during lactation and the extent of secretory activity and (b) that for a short period after parturition the rough ER elements bearing high surface densities of ribosomes have a greater proportion of ribosomes synthesizing milk proteins than the rough ER elements with moderate ribosome densities.", "pubdate_sims": "1974-06"}, "4682341": {"title": "Ribosome-membrane interaction.

At 750 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl(2), 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7 5, up to 85% of all bound ribosomes are released from the membranes after incubation at room temperature with 1 mM puromycin. The ribosomes are released as subunits which are active in peptide synthesis if programmed with polyuridylic acid.

Since puromycin-dependent ribosome release only occurs at high ionic strength, it appears that ribosomes are bound to membranes via two types of interactions: a direct one between the membrane and the large ribosomal subunit (labile at high KCl concentration) and an indirect one in which the nascent chain anchors the ribosome to the membrane (puromycin labile). The nascent chains of ribosomes specifically released by puromycin remain tightly associated with the stripped membranes. Some membrane-bound ribosomes (up to 40%) can be nondestructively released in high ionic strength media without puromycin; these appear to consist of a mixture of inactive ribosomes and ribosomes containing relatively short nascent chains. A fraction ( approximately 15%) of the bound ribosomes can only be released from membranes by exposure of RM to ionic conditions which cause extensive unfolding of ribosomal subunits, the nature and significance of these ribosomes is not clear.", "pubdate_sims": "1973-01"}, "5584018": {"title": "The formation, distribution and function of ribosomes and microsomal membranes during induced amphibian metamorphosis.", "abstract": "1. A lag period of about 4 days preceded the onset of metamorphosis precociously induced by tri-iodothyronine in tadpoles of the giant American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). It was established by the accelerated synthesis or induction of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and cytochrome oxidase in the liver, serum albumin and adult haemoglobin in the blood, acid phosphatase in the tail, and the increase in the hindleg/tail length ratio. 2. A 4- to 6-fold stimulation, 2 days after the induction of metamorphosis, of the rate of synthesis of rapidly labelled nuclear RNA in liver cells was followed by an increasing amount of RNA appearing in the cytoplasm. Most of the newly formed RNA on induction of metamorphosis was of the ribosomal type. An accelerated turnover at early stages of development preceded a net accumulation of RNA in the cytoplasm, with no change in the amount of DNA per liver. 3. Most hepatic ribosomes of the pre-metamorphic tadpoles were present as 78s monomers and 100s dimers; metamorphosis caused a shift towards larger polysomal aggregates with newly formed ribosomes that were relatively more tightly bound to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. 4. The appearance of new polyribosomes in the cytoplasm on induction of metamorphosis was co-ordinated in time with a stimulation of synthesis of phospholipids of the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, followed by a gradual shift in preponderance from the smooth to the rough type of microsomal membranes. 5. Electron- and optical-microscopic examination of intact hepatocytes revealed a striking change in the distribution and nature of ribosomes and microsomal membranes during metamorphosis. 6. Ribosomes prepared from non-metamorphosing and metamorphosing animals were identical in their sedimentation coefficients and in the structural ribosomal proteins. The base composition and sedimentation coefficients of ribosomal RNA were also identical. Induction of metamorphosis also did not alter the incorporation of (32)P into the different phospholipid constituents of microsomal membranes. 7. Nascent (14)C-labelled protein with the highest specific activity was recovered in the ;heavy' rough membrane fraction of microsomes, whereas little (14)C was associated with ;free' polysomes. Protein synthesis in vivo was most markedly stimulated during metamorphosis in the tightly membrane-bound ribosomal fraction after the appearance of new ribosomes. 8. The rate of synthesis of macromolecules in vivo could not be followed beyond 7-8 days after induction because of variable shifts in precursor pools due to regression of larval tissues. 9.

Large ribosomal subunits required a more prolonged mixing schedule to achieve saturation of membranes than did polyribosomes. 2. By using a procedure which minimized the effects on binidng by the stoicheiometric variables, competition between populations of polyribosomes, ribosomes and subunits for membrane sites showed that subunits, and to a lesser extent ribosomes, failed to block polyribosome attachment. 3.

The attachment of ribosomes to membranes is not an artifact of the separation procedure. 2. The rate of incorporation of l-[(14)C]leucine into protein in vitro by the membrane-bound and free ribosomes from these two predominantly non-protein-secreting tissues is compared with that by similar preparations from rat liver. With all three tissues the initial rate was higher for the membrane-bound preparations. 3. By using the technique of discharging nascent polypeptide chains by incubation with puromycin followed by treatment with sodium deoxycholate (Redman & Sabatini, 1966), a major difference was observed for the vectorial discharge of nascent protein synthesized both in vivo and in vitro on membrane-bound ribosomes from liver, on the one hand, and brain and muscle, on the other. Whereas a large part of nascent protein synthesized on membrane-bound liver ribosomes was discharged into the membranous vesicles (presumably destined for export from the cell), almost all nascent protein from membrane-bound ribosomes from brain and muscle was released directly into the supernatant. Incorporation of [(3)H]puromycin into peptidyl-[(3)H]puromycin confirmed these findings. There was thus no difference between membrane-bound and free ribosomes from brain on the one hand, and from free polyribosomes from liver on the other, as far as the vectorial release of newly synthesized protein was concerned. 4. Incubation with puromycin also showed that the nascent chains, pre-formed in vivo and in vitro, are not involved in the attachment of ribosomes to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. 5. The differences in vectorial discharge from membrane-bound ribosomes from liver as compared with brain and muscle are not due to the different types of messenger RNA in the different tissues. Polyphenylalanine synthesized on incubation with polyuridylic acid was handled in the same way as polypeptides synthesized with endogenous messenger. 6.

Comparison with nitroglycerin.", "abstract": "A possible role for cyclic GMP as a mediator of the endothelium-dependent relaxation of rabbit aorta by acetylcholine has been investigated using rabbit aortic rings with and without intact endothelium. In the presence of intact endothelial cells, acetylcholine caused marked increases in tissue levels of cyclic GMP accompanied by relaxation of the muscles. In aortic rings from which the endothelium had been removed, acetylcholine caused neither cyclic GMP elevation nor relaxation of the muscles. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation and cyclic GMP elevation in preparations with intact endothelium were both blocked by atropine. Reasonably good temporal and dose-response correlations between cyclic GMP elevation and relaxation were obtained with acetylcholine. Thus, although a causal relationship has not been definitely established, these results are consistent with the proposed role for cyclic GMP as a mediator of the endothelium-dependent relaxation of rabbit aorta by acetylcholine. In contrast to the results with acetylcholine, elevation of cyclic GMP and relaxation of aortic rings by nitroglycerin were not dependent on the presence of endothelial cells.

EDRF release is known to be accompanied by increased levels of cGMP in many blood vessels, and it is suggested that cGMP exerts an inhibitory influence on the smooth muscle cells, which tends to counteract the contractile effect of the clonidine. This hypothesis was tested in isolated rings of rat aorta and mesenteric artery using the cGMP lowering agent, 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione (LY83583). LY83583 markedly decreased resting levels of cGMP in these vascular preparations and completely prevented both the relaxation and the cGMP elevation normally caused by acetylcholine in rat aorta with intact endothelium. These effects of LY83583 are identical to those observed after mechanical disruption of the endothelium. LY83583 also enhanced the contractile responses to norepinephrine and particularly to clonidine in both aorta and mesenteric artery.

Clonidine did not increase cGMP levels in vascular preparations with intact endothelia, in the presence or absence of LY83583. Thus, enhanced release of EDRF by clonidine did not appear to be responsible for the inhibition of its contractile effects observed in the presence of intact endothelial cells. Our results suggest instead that this endothelium-dependent inhibition is due to spontaneous release of EDRF, which results in tonic elevation of cGMP in the vascular smooth muscle.

The chemical nature of this nonprostaglandin endothelium-derived relaxant factor (EDRF) is still not known. The possible physiological and pathophysiological significance of endothelium-dependent dilatation in situ is discussed. Special attention is paid in this context to the potential role of EDRF activity in coronary vasomotor control.", "pubdate_sims": "1985"}, "3501599": {"title": "Peptidoleukotrienes induce an endothelium-dependent relaxation of guinea pig main pulmonary artery and thoracic aorta.", "abstract": "The purpose of our investigation was to assess the role of the endothelium in the vasomotor effects of leukotrienes. Norepinephrine-preconstricted rings isolated from guinea pig main pulmonary artery and thoracic aorta responded to LTC4 and LTD4 with a concentration-dependent relaxation. In endothelium-denuded rings, both LTC4 and LTD4 caused a concentration-dependent contraction. The LTD4 receptor antagonist ICI 198,615 inhibited both LTC4- and LTD4-induced relaxation and contraction. Inhibition of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase with AT-125 prevented the effects of LTC4, but not those of LTD4. The relaxant effect of LTD4 was not modified by indomethacin, but was abolished by methylene blue. We conclude that: 1) LTD4 induces a receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation of cavian pulmonary artery and aorta; 2) the vasorelaxant effect of LTC4 requires its conversion to LTD4; 3) the vasorelaxant effect of LTD4 is unrelated to PGI2 release, and is probably due to the release of an \"EDRF\"; 4) the removal of the endothelium reveals a direct receptor-mediated vasoconstricting effect of leukotrienes.", "pubdate_sims": "1987-11"}, "3109760": {"title": "Venous and arterial endothelia: different dilator abilities in dog vessels.", "abstract": "It has been demonstrated by other investigators that endothelium-dependent vasodilators are more effective on arterial tissue than on venous tissue. The purpose of this study was to determine if this was due to a difference in the sensitivity of arterial and venous smooth muscle to the endothelial dilator (EDRF) or to a difference in the ability of arterial and venous endothelia to release EDRF. To differentiate between these two possibilities, an in vitro \"sandwich\" preparation was used in which the mechanical response to endothelium-dependent dilators of a de-endothelialized vessel was determined when \"sandwiched\" with an endothelialized vessel. Using dog femoral artery and saphenous vein, it was determined that acetylcholine (ACh), the ionophore A23187, and thrombin were endothelium-dependent dilators of the femoral artery, but their dilatory ability was significantly less in the saphenous vein. However, if the de-endothelialized saphenous vein was \"sandwiched\" with an endothelialized femoral artery, both ACh and A23187 significantly relaxed the vein. No relaxation of the de-endothelialized femoral artery occurred when it was \"sandwiched\" with an intact saphenous vein. Sodium nitroprusside, thought to act by a mechanism similar to EDRF, relaxed equally the saphenous vein and femoral artery. These observations suggest that the difference in responsiveness between femoral arteries and saphenous veins to endothelium-dependent dilators is due more to differences in the ability of their endothelia to release EDRF than to an inability of their smooth muscle to respond to EDRF.", "pubdate_sims": "1987-04"}, "3307340": {"title": "Modulation by endothelium of the vascular effects of angiotensin II.", "abstract": "Modulation by vascular endothelium of the effects of AII was studied in the isolated rabbit aortic and superior mesenteric artery strips.

However, no significant changes were observed in the contractile response to AII on aspirin and nicotine pretreated strips. In the isolated mesenteric artery strips AII produced a biphasic responses.

The relaxation phase of AII response was completely abolished in rubbed strips but partially inhibited in hydroquinone, aspirin and nicotine pretreated unrubbed strips.

This response is endothelium-dependent. The data presented here confirm the hypothesis that hydroxyl free radical mediates this response and may be the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for bradykinin in this microvascular bed. The response to a locally applied bolus of bradykinin (80 micrograms/ml) was monitored by intravital TV microscopy. The response was significantly inhibited or totally blocked by the presence of superoxide dismutase 60 U/ml, catalase 46 U/ml, or deferoxamine 0.1 or 0.2 mM. The superoxide dismutase scavenges superoxide radical, which is known to enter the subarachnoid space as a consequence of cyclooxygenase activation. Cyclooxygenase is activated by bradykinin. The superoxide can form H2O2, scavenged by catalase, and the two together generate hydroxyl. The formation of hydroxyl radical is catalyzed by iron. Deferoxamine 0.1 mM scavenges the iron, blocking the generation of hydroxyl. Deferoxamine 0.2 mM also directly scavenges the hydroxyl. None of the pharmacologic probes had an effect on arteriolar diameter when locally applied without bradykinin. Since the dilation produced by bradykinin was inhibited or totally blocked by probes that prevented hydroxyl formation or directly scavenged hydroxyl radical, that radical is either an essential mediator of the arteriolar relaxation, or is the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for bradykinin in pial arterioles.", "pubdate_sims": "1987-10"}, "3006457": {"title": "Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF).", "abstract": "Recent studies on endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation have been briefly reviewed and analyzed.

The Mr = 33,000 peptide also retains GTP sensitivity since it releases bound [125I]MIG upon addition of GTP.

Treatment of the Mr = 63,000 receptor with [125I]MIG cross-linked to it with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F results in four distinct fragments with Mr values of 61,000, 56,000, 51,000, and 45,000; prolonged treatment resulted in the accumulation of the last two. Neither the Mr = 33,000 nor the Mr = 24,000 fragment appeared to be substrates for endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F. These data indicate that glucagon receptor is a glycoprotein of approximately 60,000 daltons which contains at least four N-linked glycans accounting for 18,000 daltons of its mass. Both its glucagon binding function and its capacity to interact with the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase are contained within a fragment of only approximately 21,000 daltons that does not contain any N-linked glycans. Hormone occupancy of the receptor results in a conformational change so as to expose a region that is susceptible to proteolysis by proteases of varying specificities to yield a peptide of approximately 30,000 daltons that also does not contain N-linked glycans.", "pubdate_sims": "1984-04-25"}, "2989262": {"title": "Regulation of glucagon receptor binding.

Contrary to findings with beta-adrenergic receptors, high affinity binding of the stimulatory hormone was not dependent on Mg2+ and low affinity binding could be obtained on nucleotide addition regardless of presence of Mg2+. GDP, guanyl-5'-yl thiophosphate (GDP beta S), GTP, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) were all able to induce low affinity hormone binding. Since the Ns component of adenylyl cyclase, with which the receptor interacts, is inactive in stimulating the catalytic component C of adenylyl cyclase in the absence of Mg2+, both before and after GDP addition, it is suggested that Ns has at least two domains that change conformation independently of each other: a r domain, that interacts with the receptor and confers to it high affinity binding, and a c domain, that interacts with the catalyst C and stimulates it. It is suggested further that Ns is r+c- when stabilizing the receptor in its conformation with high affinity for hormone, and r-c- when under the influence of GDP which results in the receptor adopting the conformation that exhibits low affinity for the hormone. Comparison of potencies of the four nucleotides to induce low affinity binding showed that GDP and GDP beta S were equipotent and 10 times more potent than GTP and 100 times more potent than GMP-P(NH)P. Under the conditions used it was impossible to substantiate that the effects of GTP or GMP-P(NH)P were not due to formation of GDP from GTP or presence of GDP-like material in GMP-P(NH)P. It is suggested that, contrary to widely held opinions, GDP and GDP-like compounds, and not GTP or its analogs, are responsible for the lowering of the affinity of adenylyl cyclase stimulating receptors for their hormones or agonists.

Treatment of such N-ethylmaleimide-treated membranes, termed C- liver membranes, with guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S] ) and Mg2+, followed by the removal of GTP[gamma S] by washing, yields an activated N which upon mixing with cyc- S49 membranes reconstitutes the cyc- S49 membrane adenylyl cyclase in the absence of added GTP[gamma S]. It was found that GTP[gamma S] activation of the N at saturating concentrations of GTP[gamma S] is slow at low Mg2+ concentration and accelerated by increasing Mg2+ concentrations. Addition of glucagon during the activation results in a lowering of the Mg2+ requirement for full activation from 25 mM to around 10 muM and in concomitant increases in both the rate and the extent of N activation. In contrast to its dramatic effect on Mg2+ requirement, glucagon has little (less than 2-fold) effect on the GTP[gamma S] requirement of N activation. These experiments indicate that the glucagon receptor facilitates activation of N by: (i) decreasing the apparent Km of N for Mg2+, and (ii) increasing the extent of activation that can be elicited by saturating concentrations of guanine nucleotide.

No lag was observed in the time course of forskolin-induced activation. Addition of 10 microM guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate [GMP-P(NH)P] inhibited forskolin activation by 10-15% and 30-40%, respectively, in the presence of 3.0 mM MgCl2. GMP-P(NH)P was more potent than GTP in inhibiting forskolin activation of adenylyl cyclase having an IC50 of 36 nM compared to 610 nM for GTP. In contrast, the Kact for stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity by both GMP-P(NH)P and GTP were similar, 1.00 and 0.86 microM, respectively. GMP-P(NH)P-induced inhibition of the forskolin-activated enzyme was not due to the hysteretic nature of GMP-P(NH)P activation of luteal adenylyl cyclase, as addition of GMP-P(NH)P to an enzyme that had been treated 5 min earlier with forskolin resulted in the immediate inhibition of enzymatic activity. Addition of GMP-P(NH)P to a concentration-effect curve for forskolin increased the Kact value for forskolin form 7.18 to 26.8 microM.

In fact, at 2.0 mM MnCl2, adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of GMP-P(NH)P plus forskolin was greater than that of forskolin alone. Thus taken together, these findings suggest that the rabbit corpus luteum contains an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component in addition to a stimulatory regulatory component. Further, these components demonstrate differing requirements for both guanine nucleotides and divalent cations in order to interact with the catalytic moiety of adenylyl cyclase. The existence of such an inhibitory component suggests the presence of an inhibitory receptor in the corpus luteum which could negatively regulate adenylyl cyclase resulting in the inhibition of cAMP production and reduced progesterone output from the corpus luteum under normal physiological conditions.", "pubdate_sims": "1984-06"}, "6323531": {"title": "Glucagon-stimulable adenylyl cyclase in rat liver.

Intermittent glucagon (80-100 micrograms) injections administered at 8-h intervals to normal rats reproduced all of the above described effects of chronic experimental uremia on the adenylyl cyclase system. It is concluded that changes in the hormone-stimulable adenylyl cyclase complex in uremia and with glucagon treatment result primarily from a decrease in the number of hormone-specific receptor sites in hepatic plasma membranes. Since the changes in liver adenylyl cyclase are qualitatively and quantitatively the same in glucagon-treated and uremic rats, it is suggested that these may be the result of the hyperglucagonemia of uremia.

Further, this protein dissociates under the influence of guanine nucleotides and Mg2+ into its individual alpha and beta subunits. Because previous studies have shown that treatment of cells and cell membranes with pertussis toxin results in attenuation of the effects of hormones that inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, and because this effect correlates with the ADP-ribosylation of a Mr approximately equal to 40,000 peptide, we believe that we have purified a guanine nucleotide- and Mg2+-binding inhibitory regulatory component of adenylyl cyclases--i.e., the Ni.", "pubdate_sims": "1983-07"}, "3013309": {"title": "Characterization of glucagon receptors in Golgi fractions of rat liver: evidence for receptors that are uncoupled from adenylyl cyclase.", "abstract": "Glucagon receptors have been identified and characterized in intermediate (Gi) and heavy (Gh) Golgi fractions from rat liver.

Affinity labeling of this structure was specific for glucagon and inhibited by GTP. Glucagon stimulated the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by human membranes with half-maximal activation elicited by 6 nM hormone. The human cyclase system required GTP to facilitate an optimal glucagon response.

The effect of a brief Ca2+ exposure on NE displacement curves was not reversed by adding excess EGTA prior to binding experiments. Analysis of the curves showed that the EGTA membranes had an increased number of high affinity agonist sites (Kd, 42 nM) and that guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) converted these to low affinity sites (Kd, 1039 nM). When binding was carried out at 2 degrees C, the norepinephrine displacement curves were shifted to the left, and GppNHp was without effect. Neither EGTA, Ca2+, nor 2 degrees C treatment altered [3H]prazosin binding per se. Attempts were made to differentiate the potency order of GTP analogues which alter glucagon receptor binding (presumably mediated by the stimulatory GTP-binding protein, Na, of the adenylate cyclase system) from the potency order of GTP analogues which alter alpha 1-receptor agonist binding (presumably mediated by a yet uncharacterized GTP-binding protein which some have speculated may be distinct from Ns). However, the potency series of GTP analogues to alter norepinephrine binding was GTP gamma S greater than GppNHp greater than or equal to GTP greater than or equal to GDP greater than or equal to GppCHp greater than GMP (where GTP gamma S represents guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) and GppCHp represents guanyl-5'-yl (beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate) and was identical to that for inhibition of [125I]iodoglucagon binding. The ability of GppNHp to alter norepinephrine displacement of [3H]prazosin binding increased with the age of the rat from which membranes were prepared.

For example, GTP and Mg2+ increased the maximal velocity rather than the sensitivity of the cyclase to GTP and Mg2+. However, several unique properties distinguish the FSH-sensitive adenylyl cyclase from other hormonally activated adenylyl cyclases. First, FSH did not increase the sensitivity of the enzyme to Mg2+; thus the apparent Km for Mg2+ remained nonphysiologically high in the presence of FSH. Second, FSH was only one fourth as effective as NaF in activating the enzyme. Third, maximal activity attained in the presence of NaF was very low relative to that in other cells. Fourth, even in the presence of exogenous NAD+, cholera toxin activated adenylyl cyclase only as well as FSH rather than as well as NaF.

Addition of GTP (150 microM) or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate (100 microM) decreased the specific binding of [125I-Tyr1]SRIF to 31% and 13% of the control value, respectively. This decrease in specific binding was due entirely to decreased receptor affinity for SRIF. GTP (150 microM) increased the equilibrium dissociation constant for SRIF from 0.11 to 0.40 nM, whereas the number of binding sites was unaffected by the nucleotide (Bmax = 0.2 pmol/mg protein). Analysis of dissociation kinetics demonstrated that in the absence of guanyl nucleotides, the rate of [125I-Tyr1]SRIF dissociation was first order (t 1/2 = 180 min). However, in the presence of a half-maximal concentration of guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate (0.3 microM), [125I-Tyr1]SRIF dissociation occurred with biphasic kinetics. Fifty percent of the specifically bound peptide dissociated at the same rate as that observed in the absence of nucleotide, whereas the remainder dissociated 15 times more rapidly (t 1/2 = 9.6 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pubdate_sims": "1984-05"}, "6279654": {"title": "The hepatic angiotensin II receptor.

GTP and its nonhydrolyzable analogues greatly increased the dissociation rate of bound 125I-angiotensin II and altered hormone binding to the receptor under equilibrium conditions. In the absence of GTP, 125I-angiotensin II labeled both high affinity sites (Kd1 = 0.46 nM, N1 = 650 fmol/mg) and low affinity sites (Kd2 = 4.1 nM, N2 = 1740 fmol/mg). In the presence of guanine nucleotides, the affinities of the two sites were unchanged, but the number of high affinity sites decreased markedly to 52 fmol/mg. In analogous experiments using the angiotensin II antagonist, 125I-sarcosine1,Ala8-angiotensin II (125I-saralasin), guanine nucleotides minimally affected the interaction of 125I-saralasin with its receptor, increasing the dissociation rate 1.9-fold and the Kd 1.4-fold. The guanine nucleotide inhibition of agonist binding required a cation such as Na+ or Mg2+, with a maximal effect occurring at about 1 mM Mg2+. In liver plasma membranes prepared in EDTA, angiotensin II inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities by 30% and 10%, respectively. Angiotensin II also caused a 40% inhibition of glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in intact hepatocytes, with a half-maximal effect occurring at 1 nM. The inhibition by angiotensin II of adenylate cyclase in membranes and of cAMP levels in intact cells could be reversed by the antagonist sarcosine1,Ile8-angiotensin II. Vasopressin caused a smaller 26% inhibition of glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The ability of angiotensin II to inhibit cyclic AMP synthesis may provide an explanation for the observed effects of guanine nucleotides on 125I-angiotensin II binding to plasma membranes.", "pubdate_sims": "1982-05-10"}, "6276138": {"title": "Magnesium promotes both parathyroid hormone secretion and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production in rat parathyroid tissues and reverses the inhibitory effects of calcium on adenylate cyclase.", "abstract": "Reduced extracellular Ca2+ is known to promote PTH secretion, while severe Mg2+ depletion has the opposite effect. We have correlated the effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and cAMP accumulation by rat parathyroid tissues in vitro with the effects of these two metals on adenylate cyclase activity in broken membrane preparations. PTH secretion was maximal at 0.5 mM Ca2+, falling to low levels as the Ca2+ concentration was increased to 2.5 mM. Deletion of Mg2+ from the medium resulted in a marked decrease in PTH secretion at any given Ca2+ concentration. At a constant Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, both PTH secretion and cAMP production rose to maximal rates as the Mg2+ concentration was increased from 0 to 2 mM. The adenylate cyclase of rat parathyroid membranes was stimulated by both GTP and guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p]. EDTA-treated membranes could not be stimulated by Gpp(NH)p. Repletion with Mg2+ was more effective than repletion with Ca2+ in restoring responsiveness to the guanine nucleotide. When membranes were maximally preactivated by Gpp(NH)p and then assayed in the presence of variable concentrations of metal ions, enzyme activity was directly inhibited by Ca2+ and stimulated by Mg2+. Adenylate cyclase sensitivity to Ca2+ inhibition was dependent upon the Mg2+ concentration; in the presence of 0.6 mM Mg2+ a 50% inhibition was produced by 0.05 mM Ca2+, while in the presence of 8 mM Mg2+ a 10-fold higher Ca2+ concentration was required for a similar inhibitory effect. The results suggest that Ca2+ may decrease PTH secretion at least in part by a direct inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Mg2+ may promote PTH secretion either by enhancing the activation of adenylate cyclase by endogenous guanine nucleotides or by competing with Ca2+ for binding to a distinct regulatory site on the enzyme.", "pubdate_sims": "1982-02"}, "6087321": {"title": "Identification of glucagon receptors in rat brain.", "abstract": "The binding of radiolabeled glucagon to rat brain membranes was investigated.

Specific binding was greater to synaptosomal membrane fractions relative to myelin, mitochondrial nuclear, or microsomal fractions. Inclusion of 0.1 mM GTP in the binding assay reduced the glucagon binding affinity (KD = 44.5 nM). Several neuropeptides and other neuroactive substances tested did not affect binding of labeled glucagon to brain membranes. Three different glucagon analogs inhibited labeled glucagon binding. Synthetic human pancreatic growth hormone-releasing factor, hpGRF-44, also inhibited binding, although the concentration required for half-maximal displacement was 100-fold higher than for native glucagon. Addition of glucagon to brain membranes resulted in approximately equal to 3-fold maximal activation of adenylate cyclase over basal levels.

Guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] alone stimulated the enzyme. At a low ATP concentration (0.2 mM), TSH alone had little or no effect, but when added with Gpp(NH)p, it resulted in a dose-dependent increase of enzyme activity. Kinetic studies revealed that Gpp(NH)p alone stimulated adenylate cyclase activity only after a 10-min lag. TSH abolished the lag, resulting in an apparent increase in activity and a lowering of the activation constant for Gpp(NH)p. GTP caused an initial increase in activity at 2 min, followed by a gradual decline below basal levels. This inhibition was not prevented by TSH. Further examination revealed that GDP caused inhibition of Gpp(NH)p-stimulated activity in a competitive manner, suggesting that conversion of GTP to GDP may be responsible for the time-dependent decay seen with GTP. To study the effects of guanyl nucleotides on coupling of the TSH receptor to adenylate cyclase, plasma membranes were preactivated with saturating amounts of Gpp(NH)p and washed extensively to remove unbound Gpp(NH)p. Incubation of preactivated membranes with either Gpp(NH)p or TSH gave no further stimulation of adenylate cyclase. However, Gpp(NH)p plus TSH produced 30% more stimulation. In contrast, the addition of TSH plus GDP to preactivated membranes led to a dose-dependent decrease in activity. Furthermore, promotion of further stimulation by TSH plus Gpp(NH)p was competitively inhibited by GDP, in the same manner as untreated membranes. This suggested that the dual action of TSH, i.e, stimulation and inhibition, is governed and mediated by specific guanyl nucleotides. Analysis of guanyl nucleotides effects on the binding of [125I[iodo-TSH to membranes revealed that although some inhibition of binding exists, this effect is 1) unrelated to the concentration effect of nucleotides on adenylate cyclase, and 2) not specific for guanosine phosphates. Scatchard analysis of TSH binding in the presence of guanyl nucleotides demonstrated that even at high concentrations, GTP had no effect on the high affinity, low capacity receptor for TSH. These results suggest that GDP or Gpp(NH)p plays no role in modulating TSH-receptor interaction.

Characteristics of (125)I-labeled glucagon binding and covalent attachment to the M(r) 53,000 peptide were consistent with this peptide being a component of the glucagon receptor involved in the activation of adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1]. Binding and covalent attachment of (125)I-labeled glucagon to the M(r) 53,000 peptide were inhibited by glucagon concentrations that were within the dose-response curve for adenylate cyclase activation, and GTP specifically decreased the photoaffinity crosslinking of (125)I-labeled glucagon to the M(r) 53,000 peptides.

These effects of GDP occurred in the absence of added GTP and in the absence of sufficient formation of GTP by putative transphosphorylation reaction(s) to account for them. It is concluded that two levels of regulation of liver adenylyl cyclase (cyclizing) activity must exit. One level is termed \"receptor regulation\"; it depends on occupancy of a receptor-related R site by nucleotide and is specific for either GDP or GTP. The second level of regulation is termed \"GTPase regulation\"; it is inhibited by GDP, depends on both GTP and GTPase, and accounts for activation of cyclizing activity by nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP.

Activities were compared with ATP and 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (App(NH)p) as substrates. The Km for both substrates was about 50 muM; Vmax given with App(NH)p was about 40% lower than obtained with ATP as substrate. In the presence of a saturating concentration of substrate (1 mM), basal activity was increased 4-fold by increasing [Mg2+] from 5 to 50 mM. The stimulatory effect of Mg2+ was not due to an allosteric action since basal activity was only marginally enhanced (40%) when the substrate concentration was reduced to 10 muM. As suggested by deHaen ((1974 J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2756), it is likely that Mg2+ increases enzyme activity by decreasing the concentration of an inhibitory, unchelated form of substrate that competes with the productive magnesium-substrate complex at the active site. Activity-pH profiles differed with ATP and App(NH)p as substrates; a shift in pH optimum was observed which correlated with the different pKa of the terminal phosphate groups of ATP and App(nh)p, and which reflect the concentration of protonated substrate (ATPH-3 minus) present in the incubation medium. Accordingly, protonated substrate is the predominant inhibitory species of unchelated substrate and probably has a considerably higher affinity for the active site than does the magnesium-substrate complex. Glucagon-stimulated activity was less susceptible to inhibition by protonated substrate than is the basal state as evidenced by lower stimulatory effect when the [Mg2+] was increased from 5 to 20 mM. However, increasing the [Mg2+] from 20 to 50 mM resulted in marked inhibition of glucagon-stimulated activity, particularly in the presence of 10 muM substrate. Conversely, at a fixed [Mg2+], concentrations of substrate at least 20-fold higher than the Km were required to achieve maximal hormone-stimulated activity. These findings suggest that the unchelated, fully ionized form of substrate serves as an activating ligand, as has been observed with guanine nucleotides at considerably lower concentrations. Thus, Mg2+ affects adenylate cyclase activity by forming the productive substrate complex and by titrating the inhibitory protonated and activating free forms of substrate. As a result of these effects of unchelated substrate, it proved difficult to evaluate the kinetic parameters involved in substrate binding and utilization and the effects of hormone thereon when substrate was added as the only source of activating ligand. However, linear Michaelis kinetic data were obtained by adding the activating ligand 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate with glucagon and by making appropriate adjustments of pH and [Mg2+].

The photoaffinity peptide specifically labeled a number of bands with apparent molecular weights greater than 200000 and probably at least two protein bands in the molecular weight range 52000-70000. The relative amounts of radioactivity associated with these bands and their relative mobilities differed in samples from reduced and unreduced membranes. Their relative mobilities also differed with percent acrylamide cross-linking, suggesting a glycoprotein nature and the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. A nonspecifically labeled band with an apparent molecular weight of 27000-28000 also displayed a similar behavior. Photolabeling in the presence of 0.1 mM guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) decreased the amount of radiolabeling of these bands, suggesting their involvement in the glucagon stimulation of adenylate cyclase.

Addition of GTP to the solubilized glucagon receptor of nonirradiated membranes caused complete dissociation of the complex. Gel electrophoresis of the partially purified radiolabeled receptor identified the same protein components observed in photolabeled membranes. These results indicate that the glucagon receptor is an oligomer probably composed of at least two different subunits that are linked together or greatly stabilized by disulfide bonds.

The stimulatory effects of Gpp(NH)p or F- remained essentially unaffected even at maximal hydrolysis of phospholipids, whereas the stimulatory effect of GTP was reduced. Detailed analysis of receptor binding indicates that phospholipase A2 treatment affected the affinity but not the number of glucagon receptors. The receptors remain sensitive to the effects of GTP on hormone binding. Filipin also caused marked reduction in activation by glucagon + GTP. However, in contrast to phospholipase A2 treatment, the binding of glucagon to receptors was unaffected. The effect of GTP on the binding process was also not affected. The most sensitive parameter of activity altered by filipin was stimulation by GTP or Gpp(NH)p; basal and fluoride-stimulated activities were least affected.

Addition of pure Ns to glucagon-treated MDCK cell membranes restored full stimulation by NaF but did not restore stimulation by prostaglandin E1 or glucagon. It is concluded that glucagon induces heterologous and homologous desensitization of the MDCK cell adenylyl cyclase.

The affinity of the specific chick liver binding sites for APP was low; 500 ng unlabeled APP/ml (1.2 X 10(-7) M) were required for half-maximal displacement of [125I]iodo-APP.

Mg2+ alone also decreases [3H]CHA binding, which is associated with a decrease in the number of receptors and in the dissociation constant. In the presence of Mg2+, the effect of GTP is to increase [3H]CHA binding by increasing the total number of receptors. It thus appears that Mg2+ acts specifically at a bivalent-cation site which, with GTP, regulates agonist binding. This putative Mg site is highly sensitive to alkylating agents. Mild treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) abolishes the characteristic GTP effect on agonist binding in the presence of Mg2+. In addition, the effect of Mg2+ alone is also eliminated. The effect of GTP alone is largely unaltered. Studies of the adenylate cyclase activity indicate that this NEM treatment also abolishes the inhibition of basal activity by adenosine analogues, whereas guanylyl imidodiphosphate inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity is only slightly impaired at this NEM concentration.

Iodination of the two tyrosyl residues occurs first and is nearly complete after addition of a 4-fold molar excess of ICl. Iodination of the single histidyl residue is a later event and does not exceed an average of one atom per residue. Hydrolysis of iodoglucagon by trypsin and subsequent separation of the iodotyrosyl peptides shows that iodine is equally distributed between tyrosyl residues 10 and 13. Crude iodoglucagon containing an average of 1 g-atom of iodine per mol has been resolved into several components of differing iodine content and iodoamino acid composition by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Monoiodoglucagon isolated by this procedure shows a single band when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Iodoglucagons containing an average of 1 to 4 g-atoms of iodine per mol are more potent than native glucagon in their ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity and to bind to glucagon receptors of liver cell membranes of the rat. The maximal increase in biological potency occurring upon iodination is about 5-fold with respect to adenylate cyclase activity, and 2-fold with respect to binding to receptors; tetra and triiodinated derivatives show, respectively, the highest potency. Similar effects occur whether inactivation by liver membranes is inhibited or not, indicating an enhancement in the intrinsic affinity of iodoglucagon for the receptors. Iodination beyong 4 g-atoms per mol slightly decreases the affinity of the hormone for adenylate cyclase and for the receptors.

Inclusion of EGTA and/or proteinase inhibitors during membrane preparation and incubation increased the effect of GTP[gamma S] on alpha 1-adrenergic agonist binding and this could be correlated with increased concentrations of a 78 kDa photoaffinity labeled protein. In contrast, omission of EGTA or addition of exogenous Ca2+ diminished or abolished the effect of GTP[gamma S] on binding and caused loss of the 78 kDa form and the appearance of lower molecular weight labeled proteins. Age-dependent differences in GTP[gamma S] effects on alpha 1-adrenergic agonist binding were abolished when membranes were prepared and incubated in the presence of EGTA and proteinase inhibitors.

The basic model proposes that the adenylate cyclase system can exist in two states, A and B; that activating ligands bind preferentially to the B state; and that only the B state is active. Kinetic data are quantitatively fit to this model, and the binding constants for the interaction of the A and B states with glucagon, GTP, and guanyl-5'-ylimidodiphosphate are obtinaed. The substrates ATP and adenyl-5'-ylimidodiphosphate appear to show little preference between the A and B states, and simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics are sufficient to describe the dependence of the catalytic rate on substrate concentration under optimal conditions. The dependence of the rate on pH can be explained by postulating that one ionizable group in its acid form and one ionizable group in its basic form must be present at the active site in order for catalysis to occur. The activation and inhibition of the activity by Mg2+ can be explained by a similar mechanism with Mg2+ binding to activating and inhibiting sites. Glucagon and guanosine nucleotides appear to influence the dependence of the rate on Mg2+ and glucagon. The Mg2+ also may display some preference for the B state.

After correcting for the smaller surface area of foetal hepatocytes, glucagon receptor concentrations were still lower in foetuses than in adult rats. The time courses of glucagon association to liver membranes and of glucagon receptor degradation of prenatal and postnatal rats were similar, while inactivation of glucagon by liver membranes was significantly lower in foetal than in adult rats. Also, glucagon-stimulated production of cAMP was smaller in younger rats.

Complete inhibition was obtained with 0.1 mM mersalyl. Similar effects were observed whether the adenylate cyclase preparation was assayed in the presence of 10 muM GTP, 0.1 muM glucagon, 10 mM NaF or without any addition. The effect of mersalyl was not due to inhibition of the regenerating system present in the incubation medium, since the effect of mersalyl was preserved and even enhanced in its absence. The inhibition brought about by mersalyl was due to both a decrease of the maximal velocity of the reaction and of the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. It was immediate, and irreversible spontaneously, but it was reversed by the simultaneous additions of 2-mercaptoethanol, in a dose-dependent fashion. Other -SH reagents were found to have an effect equal to, or lower than, that of mersalyl. Mersalyl had no effect upon Mg2+-ATPase, although it inhibited the (Na+-K+) activated ATPase. Since mersalyl is known to be a 'non-penetrant' reagent, it is postulated that a catalytically important, mercurial-sensitive, part of adenylate cyclase is at the surface of the plasma membrane. This view is supported by the following facts: (a) mersalyl acted with a similar dose-response curve upon an intact as well as a detergent-dispersed cyclase preparation while no effect was observed upon a solubilized Mg2+-ATPase preparation; (b) a covalent p-chloromercuribenzoate-Sephadex preparation (but not its supernatant) inhibited the cyclase from intact membranes.

These results suggest that interaction of glucagon with its receptor in the membrane resulted in conformational changes which increased either the exposure or nucleophilicity of one or more sulfhydryl groups crucial for adenylate cyclase activity. Membranes were treated with radioactively labeled iodoacetamide or iodoacetic acid in the presence or absence of glucagon and run on 5 and 7.5% sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gels.

This polypeptide accounted for approximately 1.3% of the total membrane protein.

The enhancement in labeling of the 240,000 molecular weight component seen in the presence of glucagon agreed very well with that predicted from the kinetics for inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in the presence and absence of glucagon.

However, the PTH peptides are more effective than secretin, which up to a concentration of 10(-5) M exhibits no ability to displace [125I]iodoglucagon. The greater potency of PTH compared with secretin occurs despite the fact that secretin shows a great deal of sequence homology with glucagon while PTH shows none. We demonstrate by circular dichroism that in the presence of 3 mM SDS glucagon and hPTH(1-34) have similar secondary structure contents, while secretin is more helical. Our results suggest that receptors can recognize gross conformational features of a peptide hormone in addition to interacting with a specific amino acid sequence. The ability of PTH to interact with glucagon receptors can be modulated by incorporation of charged amphiphiles into the plasma membrane. Negatively charged taurodeoxycholic acid increases the binding of the more cationic PTH while positively charged myristyltrimethylammonium bromide decreases this interaction.

At pH 8.5, the affinity of the receptor for native glucagon is the same as that seen at pH 7.0. However, iodinated glucagon binds with a lowered affinity with increasing pH. The decreased affinity of the iodinated hormone correlates with ionization of the iodotyrosyl phenoxy groups, which has a pKa of 8.2. It is suggested that the decreased affinity is actually due to the inability of the ionized iodoglucagon to bind to the receptor. The relative potency of native and iodoglucagon will depend, therefore, on the concentrations of ionized and un-ionized species of iodoglucagon, which in turn depend on the pH of the medium. We conclude that incorporation of iodine atoms in the tyrosyl residues of glucagon has two major effects: (i) the iodine atom increases hydrophobic interaction of the hormone with the receptor and (ii) ionization of the phenoxy groups results in the loss of biological activity possibly as the result of loss of hydrogen bonding capability.

The deprotected, purified product was chemically identical to N epsilon- acetimidoglucagon and equipotent to N epsilon- acetimidoglucagon and native glucagon in its ability to activate adenylate cyclase and displace [125I] iodoglucagon from rat liver plasma membranes.

The biological assays indicate that the amino group is involved to a greater extent in transduction than in binding, but the aromatic nature and hydrogen bonding capability of the imidazole ring of histidine-1 are important for both binding and transduction. In circular dichroism studies, all derivatives exhibited increased helicity in 2-chloroethanol. The [ Phe1 ] analogue although less soluble behaved similarly to native glucagon, while the [ Ala1 ] and [des- His1 ] derivatives exhibited an increased helical content in 0.01 N HCl as a result of an increased propensity of these derivatives to self-associate in the absence of 2-chloroethanol.

Cold acclimation decreased the size and increased the number of epididymal white adipocytes. Cold acclimation increased the number of glucagon receptors of white adipocytes, resulting in 140% in terms of unit cell, and 260% increase per unit surface area and 210% increase per whole tissue.

All membrane fractions exhibited reversible binding of 125I-toxin which was competitively inhibited by unlabeled toxin. Toxin receptors from liver co-purified with plasma membranes and the plasma membrane marker 5'-nucleotidase. One-half saturation of all receptors occurred between 5 x 10(-8) and 1.8 x 10(-7) M.

Over 95% of the toxin specific binding was inhibited by removal of divalent cation from the medium or by the inclusion of 1 mM ATP, procedures which have been shown to protect sensitive cells from intoxication by diphtheria toxin.

Although calculated dissociation constants for hormone binding range from 0.2 to 400 nM, whether considering glucagon or deshistidine glucagon binding, or binding to the high affinity or low affinity receptor populations, receptor affinity increases 2- to 100-fold in the environment of the membrane vesicle; concomitant with this alteration in receptor affinity, receptor selectivity for the structure of the native hormone decreases 1.5- to 40-fold in hepatocyte-derived vesicles. Consideration of receptor affinity in relation to receptor number suggests that hepatocyte glucagon binding is distributed about equally between high and low affinity receptor populations at typical portal hormone levels.

The intact separated heavy (H) and light (L) strands of adenovirus type 12 DNA have been used to determine the extent of complementarity of the mRNA or nuclear RNA from different cell lines to each of the strands. More precise map positions have been obtained by the use of the H and L complements of the fragments of adenovirus type 12 DNA which were produced with the EcoRI and BamHI restriction endonucleases. The results of the mapping experiments demonstrate that the mRNA's isolated early from productively and abortively infected and from two lines of transformed cells are derived from the same or similar regions of the adenovirus type 12 genome. The map positions on the adenovirus type 12 genome for the mRNA from the cell lines as indicated correspond to regions located approximately between 0 and 0.1 and 0.74 and 0.88 fractional length units on the L strand and to regions between 0.63 and 0.74 and 0.89 and 1.0 fractional length units on the H strand.

The polarity of the H strand has its 3'-end on the right terminus in the EcoRI A fragment, and the L strand has its 3'-end on the left terminus in the EcoRI C fragment. Thus, the H strand is transcribed from right to left (1 = leftward strand); and the L strand is transcribed from left to right (r = rightward strand). The designations H and L refer to the relative heavy and light densities of the two strands in polyuridylic-polyguanylic acid-CsCl density gradients.

Hybridization competition indicated that HindIII-G-specific mRNA was present in the polysomes at one-sixth the concentration late after infection as compared with early, indicating that the proteins coded by the transforming segment may be synthesized at reduced amounts during late stages. Only 1/10 the amount of RNA labeled late annealed to the G fragment as compared with that labeled early (per weight of RNA). Thus, synthesis of transforming gene mRNA is probably \"turned off\" late after infection. Both 24S (22S) and 14S mRNA's from infected and 8617 cells were complementary to the Hpa I-E fragment (left 4.1% of genome). The Hpa I-E fragment is too small to encode 24S and 14S species, which implies that the 5'-terminal regions of both species are coded by the same DNA sequences.", "pubdate_sims": "1976-10"}, "902315": {"title": "Viral DNA sequences from incomplete particles of human adenovirus type 7.", "abstract": "Large pools of empty viral capsids accumulate in cells infected by subgroup B human adenoviruses.

DNA isolated from carefully purified classes of Ad7 incomplete particles was analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage, gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. At least 90% of the DNA molecules in each sample consisted of sequences that extended from the left end of the viral genome map by variable lengths toward the right end. The average length of DNA is linearly related to the average buoyant density of the  incomplete particles from which the DNA is isolated. The results indicate that each capsid contains one DNA molecule. There is also a specific association of the left end of the viral genome with assembled or assembling capsids.

The putative cap 1 contains all the methylated constituents of cap 1 plus Cm. The molar ratios of m7G to 2'-O-methylnucleosides is about 1.0 for cap 1 and 0.5 for cap 2, consistent with the proposed cap structures. Most significant, compositional analysis indicates four different cap 1 structures and at least three different cap 2 structures. Thus there is a minimum of seven early viral mRNA species with different cap structures, unless each type of mRNA can have more than one 5' terminus. In addition to methylated caps, early mRNA contains internal base methylations, exclusively as m6A, as shown by analyses of the mononucleotide (-2 charge) fraction. m6A was present in the ratio of 1 mol of m6Ap per 450 nucleotides.

Rous sarcoma virus, a representative of avian oncornaviruses, manifests two major functions: cell transformation and virus replication. Both functions are independent, and are expressed separately in defective viruses. The virus has a 60-70S RNA, composed of 35 S subunits. It appears that each subunit of viral RNA carries the same genetic information and, furthermore, that 10% of this information is coding for cell transformation. Without this 10% the virus can still replicate. The RNA genome is expressed when the virus penetrates a sensitive cell, provided the virus carries an active reverse transcriptase. Virus-transformed cells possess a DNA form of the viral genome. The viral DNA is infectious, and can lead, upon transfection of permissive cells, to the production of a new viral progeny. We have established that the minimum molecular weight of the viral DNA is 6 X 10(6) daltons, and that this DNA is covalently bound to the chromosomal DNA. Also by examining the frequency of transfection events in the DNA-treated cells we suggest that transfection is a single-hit phenomenon. It follows that viral DNA of 6 X 10(6) daltons carries all the genetic information to code for the virus production. It seems likely that the transfection mechanism giving rise to transforming viruses is different from that producing nontransforming segments. In general terms, the experimental data indicate that certain RNAs and DNAs could accomplish malignant transformation if they are able to penetrate into the cell and give rise to the DNA forms which could be integrated into the cellular genome.", "pubdate_sims": "1975"}, "4335270": {"title": "[Distribution of leukosis-sarcoma complex viruses among birds].", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1971-12"}, "169318": {"title": "Genetic susceptibility of chicken times quail hybrid embryos to avian RNA tumour viruses.", "abstract": "An attempt was made to hybridize the chicken (Gallus domesticus) male with Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) female in order to study the genetic susceptibility of hybrid embryos to avian RNA tumour viruses of subgroups, A, B, D and E.

It was also observed that the Ie gene of the chicken was unable to suppress the 'quail-coded' susceptibility to subgroup E virus in the hybrid system, suggesting the lack of penetrance of the Ie gene. Despite the fact that some hybrids were resistant to viruses of subgroups B and D, they were susceptible to subgroup E virus, which was not expected on the basis of the concept that subgroup B-resistant cells cannot be E-susceptible.

The behaviour of the preparation during sedimentation at 105000g and attempts at purification indicated that the activities were particulate. Electron microscopy demonstrated the rupture of vesicular structures approx. 0.5mu in diameter concurrent with the release of activity. 3. The three activities were always associated throughout repeated attempts at separation by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation and Sephadex-gel filtration. On the basis of kinetic studies, stability studies and treatment with butanol and ribonuclease it was concluded that a separate enzyme is responsible for each of the three activities. Widely varying plots of activity as a function of pH were consistent with this conclusion. 4. On the basis of sensitivity of the enzymes hydrolysing dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and oestrone sulphate to ribonuclease and sensitivity of all three enzymes to lipase, it was concluded that the three enzymes are bound to a particle containing lipid and RNA.

The amount of PGG(2) (prostaglandin G(2)) produced as calculated from the sum of the amounts of its metabolites (HHT and PHD) was 2477-5480 ng/ml. In contrast, the amounts of PGE(2) (prostaglandin E(2)) and PGF(2alpha) (prostaglandin F(2alpha)) released were approximately two orders of magnitude lower. In this system, the prostaglandins thus exert their biological action through the endoperoxides, which are almost exclusively metabolized to nonprostanoate structures and only to a small extent to the classical prostaglandins. Platelets from subjects given aspirin produced less than 5% of the above mentioned amounts of HHT and PHD, whereas the production of HETE was stimulated about 3-fold.

Guinea pigs with delayed hypersensitivity to one of the avian antigens had a slower antibody response to a secondary injection of heterologous antigen than to one of the homologous antigen. Sensitization with a protein conjugated with a hapten such as picryl chloride (Pi) or dinitrofluorobenzene (DFB) resulted in delayed hypersensitivity to the homologous conjugate, the homologous protein, and the homologous protein with a heterologous hapten. Circulating antibody and Arthus reactions occurred subsequently to the homologous conjugate, as well as to the homologous hapten attached to a heterologous protein. Delayed hypersensitivity thus seemed associated with the protein moiety, and Arthus responses with the hapten. Anamnestic responses followed injection of an antigen causing delayed hypersensitivity, but not of a hapten not causing delayed reactions. Thus, animals sensitized initially with Pi.HEA, DFB.HEA, or HEA produced antibodies sooner after a secondary injection of Pi.HEA than did unsensitized animals. No anamnestic response resulted when animals sensitized to Pi.BGG were injected with Pi.HEA. Thus, delayed hypersensitivity is indicated to be a preliminary and immature step in the immune process, with specificity directed against broad, more general features of the protein antigen. This intermediate step is followed by production of circulating antibody to any antigen having a similar basic structure, with the specificity of the antibody also directed against smaller immunologically active sites on the antigen molecule.", "pubdate_sims": "1960-04-01"}, "13967257": {"title": "Properties of guinea pig 7S antibodies.

A similar enhancement in normal rats has been obtained with C' component reagents possessing properties associated with the third component of C'. Parallelisms between in vitro fixation of C' and PCA induction by antigen and antibody are shown. The horse anti-pneumococcus system has low C'-fixing potencies and is also less efficient than the rabbit polysaccharide system in the induction of PCA. Findings of a similar nature were observed in the reaction of rabbit anti-ribonuclease with ribonuclease, the acetylated and guanidinated derivatives of the enzyme. The injection of hemolytically active serum into C'-deficient rats was accompanied by a partial restoration of PCA. Restorative effects were also noted with heated and ammonia-treated serum. The return of hemolytic potency and responsiveness to PCA in C'-depleted rats, follow a similar time course.

Less anaphylatoxin is formed by aggregates formed with excess antigen than those in equivalence ratio combination. C' fixation, as well as anaphylatoxin production, may be inhibited by chelation of the divalent cations, presumably by interfering with the fixation of C'(1), C'(4), and C'(2). Phlorizin suppresses the utilization of C'(3) in immune hemolysis, C' fixation by antigen-antibody aggregates, and the production of anaphylatoxin. The biological activities associated with the fixation of C' are not manifest unless C'(3) participates in this process at 37 degrees C.

It was observed that following a reaction of substantial degree in guinea pig skin the area involved does not fully recover for some days its capacity to react, the effect being a manifestation, it would seem, of what has been termed \"non-specific antianaphylaxis.\"", "pubdate_sims": "1947-11-30"}, "19971760": {"title": "On Serum Anaphylaxis in the Guinea-Pig.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1907-05"}, "19971833": {"title": "Further studies in Anaphylaxis : I.

II. Demonstration of cyclic permeability change accompanying virus infection of Escherichia coli B cells.", "abstract": "The virus-induced leakage of host-cell constituents represents a true increase in cellular permeability rather than an unpeeling of cell surface components, since an intracellular enzyme participates in the leakage. All of the T-system bacteriophages exhibit this leakage. The leakage does not occur with salt concentrations which permit only reversible virus-cell attachment but no penetration. These facts support the idea that the reaction underlying cell leakage is a part of the invasive mechanism. With increasing multiplicity of T2 infection of young, fresh Escherichia coli B cells, progressively larger molecules leak out of the cell. Acid-soluble P(32) appears in large amounts with single infection. Appreciable amounts of galactosidase enzyme and RNA do not leak until multiplicities of 5 to 30 are attained. Cellular DNA is not liberated unless sufficiently high multiplicities are used to cause the extensive cell destruction and clearing of the suspension characteristic of lysis-from-without. This progression is interpreted as an increase with T2 multiplicity in the maximum hole size produced in the cell membrane. Calculation shows that this increase in hole size must result from a spreading change in the character of the cell wall, rather than the coincidental juxtaposition of 2 or more viruses at adjacent attachment sites. T1 virus liberates less macromolecular constituents than T2 from E. coli B. The following experimental results constitute evidence that in the course of normal virus infection, a resealing reaction is rapidly instituted in the cell wall which reverses the effect of the original permeability increase, and renders the cell refractory to a second lytic reaction by a homologous virus: (a) Cell leakage induced by T2 virus in the course of normal infection markedly slows down or stops within a few minutes, even when only a small fraction of the material potentially available for leakage has been released, (b) Superinfection after 8 minutes at 37 degrees C., of a cell previously infected with a homologous virus causes little or no appearance of a second leakage of cell constituents. This experiment also leads to the conclusion that the sealing reaction, like that which causes the leakage, also involves a disturbance which spreads over all or most of the cell wall. (c) If a multiple virus infection is allowed to occur at 0 degrees C. and then the cells are placed in a 37 degrees C. bath after completion of attachment, a much greater cell leakage results than if the entire course had occurred at 37 degrees C., as would be expected if a resealing reaction comes into play at 37 degrees C. within a time less than that required by the completion of attachment. The virus particles attaching secondarily at 37 degrees C. are prevented from exercising their permeability-increasing effect by the sealing reaction of the virus which had penetrated first. Although a second homologous cell infection with T1 or T2 phages after a 37 degrees C. incubation fails to yield a second leakage, a second heterologous infection always causes exacerbation of new leakage, which, especially if T1 has preceded T2, may be much greater than the sum of those produced individually by each virus in separate cell suspensions. This phenomenon may be the action responsible for the \"depressor\" effect which occurs when 2 unrelated viruses attack the same cell. The properties of the sealing phenomenon are such as to make it appear a logical candidate for the mechanism underlying the exclusion of a superinfecting phage from participating in reproductive processes in a cell previously infected with a homologous virus, since the DNA of the second virus would be unable to penetrate the new barrier. Experiments to test this hypothesis revealed that the DNA from such superinfecting virus is completely extractable from cells by washing in dilute buffer, whereas about 40 to 50 per cent of the attached DNA of virus which has invaded virgin cells remains bound to the cells. Most of the viral DNA which appears in the original supernatant when P(32)-labelled T2 invades E. coli B in a multiplicity less than one, does not represent inert material but rather virus DNA which has been split, or split and hydrolyzed as a result of its interaction with the cells, as judged by the altered susceptibility to hydrolytic enzyme or to TCA precipitation. This suggests that 25 per cent or more of the virus DNA may be expendable, at least after the penetration stage of the infection cycle. Mg(++) which strongly depresses the amount of cell leakage attending T2 infection, does not prevent T2 penetration nor does it block the appearance of the exclusion reaction. Hence, if the initial leakage does mirror the lytic process by which a hole for the DNA injection is provided, the Mg(++) does not function by preventing this hole formation. Its effect would have to lie in prevention of the spreading lysis-potentiating reaction or in augmenting the sealing mechanism. A large number of independent lines of evidence indicate that the phenomenon of lysis-from-without exhibited by the T-even coliphages is the result of failure of the sealing mechanism to keep pace with the lytic reaction. This can result from an excess of infecting phages or inhibition of the cellular energy-liberating reaction required by the sealing mechanism. The complete parallelism between the development of refractoriness to lysis-from-without and development of refractoriness to the production of a new leakage from a homologous superinfection is especially convincing in this connection. It is proposed that the early phase of bacteriophage invasion involves the following steps: reversible electrostatic attachment; splitting of the viral DNA from its protein coat; initiation of a lytic reaction in the cell wall at the site of virus attachment; injection of the DNA through the hole so produced; a spreading disturbance over the cell surface which makes it momentarily more susceptible to the lytic reaction; sealing of the hole and a concommittant spread over the cell wall of a reaction making the cell refractory to initiation of a second lytic reaction. Na(+), K(+), and Mg(++) all behave differently in their effect on the leakage produced in the course of T2 invasion of E. coli.", "pubdate_sims": "1955-02-01"}, "13860941": {"title": "Glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase of Escherichia coli following infection with T2 bacteriophage.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1961"}, "13752286": {"title": "A mutation affecting the DNA content of bacteriophage lambda and its lysogenizing properties.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1961-08"}, "13736649": {"title": "Phage transformation: a new criterium for the biological activity of bacteriophage DNA.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1961-04-01"}, "13875618": {"title": "A minimum estimate for the length of the DNA of Escherichia coli obtained by autoradiography.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1962-05"}, "14463751": {"title": "The deoxyribonucleases of Escherichia coli.

Gel filtration was found to be suitable for the purification of these extracts. The releasing factor appeared to be a basic peptide of molecular weight in the range 1200-2500. On a larger scale, an extract of hypothalamic tissue from sheep was used to establish a multi-stage isolation procedure that resulted in a 200000-fold purification of luteinizing-hormone-releasing factor. After the initial extraction the isolation process consisted of: (1) two cycles of gel filtration; (2) anion-exchange chromatography; (3) gel filtration in a partially organic medium; (4) thin-layer chromatography on cellulose. Stage (3) separated two zones of activity each containing peptides. One of these was purified further by stage (4) to give a preparation that was active at a dose of 6mug. of peptide/animal, although activity diminished seriously during storage.

Growth curves showed that each cycle was composed of (a) an initial lag phase when little or no virus was released from the cells, (6) a phase of viral production, and (c) a plateau which represented a decrement in the rate of viral production. This pattern of viral multiplication occurred in monkey testicular tissue cultures which have as the liquid phase either ox serum ultrafiltrate or monkey serum-chicken embryonic extract medium. The presence of a solid medium composed of chicken plasma, clotted either with chicken embryonic extract or bovine thrombin, did not alter the pattern of viral multiplication. The shape of the growth curve as established by any of four different techniques for tissue cultivation, was shown to be independent of the cultural technique employed. For cultures of monkey testicular tissue, the amount of virus in the tissue was as much as tenfold greater than that in the liquid of the same cultures. Moreover, viral production was evident earlier and was detectable for a longer period of time in the tissue than in the liquid phase. The rapidly incremental phase of the growth cycle, when large quantities of virus were released into the liquid phase, coincided in time with the destruction of the spindle-shaped cells, which extended from the explants.

However when varying dilutions of the sera were tested against a single dose of virus, it was found that the antibody was present in lowest concentration early after onset and progressively increased in titer over a period of weeks during convalescence. The 2 remaining high titer strains were recovered from patients with a non-paralytic illness, and in both of these the acute phase sera were without significant amounts of antibody for their own virus. Antibody was demonstrable at 14, 28, and 92 days after onset in one of these patients, while the other had none at 1 month and only a minimal amount at 3 and 8 months. Tests with the Lansing virus on the same sera, clearly established the specificity of the antibody response to the strain of virus recovered from each patient under investigation. Five of the 9 patients, whose sera were studied with both viruses, had no antibody for the Lansing virus during the acute phase and none 3 months later. Two had antibody during the acute phase but serum dilution tests showed no increase in titer in the 3 month convalescent specimen. In 2 others, who were without antibody for the Lansing virus during the acute phase but had it at 3 months after onset, it was possible to show that this antibody appeared later than 1 month after the illness and that the virus recovered from these patients during their illness was not antigenically of the Lansing type.", "pubdate_sims": "1949-10"}, "14844382": {"title": "Propagation of poliomyelitis virus in cultures of monkey and human testicular tissues.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1951-05"}, "13134213": {"title": "Poliomyelitis virus in tissue culture.

Some relationship can be demonstrated between the amount of nervous tissue and the infectivity of the culture. 3. Optimum titers of virus potency (10(-6)) can be obtained by adjusting the pH of the growing culture at 7.3 to 7.6. 4. A simple pH inactivation curve for virus alone and for virus when actively growing in tissue culture has been obtained. 5. The rate of virus propagation, as determined by potency tests in mice, has been established for cultures which were seeded with large or small amounts of virus. The murine virus \"grows\" relatively fast. The optimum titer for a large inoculum was reached in 19 hours, for a small inoculum in 72 hours. 6. With extended subcultivation in vitro the cultured virus shows a loss of infectivity for mice by peripheral injection. However, potency as determined by intracerebral injection remains constant. 7. Mice surviving inoculation of culture virus by routes other than intracerebral acquire a relative resistance to reinfection with mouse passage virus. 8. The murine culture virus passes without difficulty through collodion membranes with an A.P.D. of 30 mmicro. Its particle size may therefore be estimated as lying between 10 to 15 mmicro. 9. On a basis of in vitro activity and cross infection, the murine culture virus is distinct from the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis. 10. Murine culture virus may be used as an interfering agent to block infection with poliomyelitis virus in monkeys. The interaction between the two viruses seems to be quantitatively limited.

The murine virus, while highly pathogenic for mice and cotton rats, is non-pathogenic for albino rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. It possesses limited pathogenicity for rhesus monkeys. 5. Although producing no paralysis in the above mentioned refractory animals, the murine virus may be recovered in active form from neural and extraneural sites of infected albino rats, guinea pigs, and monkeys, but not from rabbits. 6. The identity of the murine and monkey virus is further suggested by cross-neutralization between the murine virus and homologous (SK) and related (Aycock) antipoliomyelitis sera, as well as between homologous and related monkey poliomyelitis virus and antimurine virus sera. 7. Immunization of monkeys with live murine virus, in the form of mouse brain or tissue culture, seems to confer some degree of resistance against subsequent infection with the homologous poliomyelitis monkey virus. 8.

Mixture tests carried out with graded doses of murine and monkey virus show that 0.5 cc. of a 10 per cent suspension prepared from the brains of paralyzed mice is capable of counteracting at least 100 minimal paralyzing doses of two strains of monkey virus. 4.

Smillie and Amoss indicated that the bacteria may be agonal invaders. The results of the experiments reported in this paper point to another source of the streptococci. They occur as contaminants which are introduced into the cultures during the process of grinding tissues. The source of the streptococcus may therefore be the air of the place in which the cultures are made. We have come to this conclusion because first, the tissues of which cultures yielded streptococci were derived from a number of monkeys with experimental poliomyelitis still in a vigorous state. Secondly, when the tissues were ground bacteria were noted much more frequently in their cultures than in those in which fragments of the same brains were used. Thirdly, microorganisms occurred more often in cultures made in the routine laboratory than in a special room where asepsis was carried to the extreme of a major surgical operation on man. Fourthly, streptococci were obtained from the air of the places where cultures were made. Finally, there is no correlation between the cultures of two portions of the same brain. The streptococci occurred in some cultures in pure growth and in others admixed with other ordinary species of bacteria. The latter were often found, in turn, in pure culture and what applies to streptococci, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, applies equally to the staphylococci, diphtheroids, spore-bearing rods, and other miscellaneous, familiar microorganisms. We could not determine that there exists any etiological relation of the streptococci to poliomyelitis. The fermentation reactions of the microorganisms obtained from the air, from non-poliomyelitic and poliomyelitic monkey brains indicate that bacteria from any of these sources are markedly different. So also with the serological reactions of agglutination and precipitation. Furthermore no agglutination was observed when the serum of monkeys convalescent from experimental poliomyelitis was mixed with any of the streptococci recovered or those received directly or indirectly from Rosenow. Moreover, the intracerebral injection with cultures, irrespective of their source, induced in rabbits a purulent type of meningoencephalitis, often associated with streptococcic septicemia.

The present paper constitutes a preliminary study of the morphology of mitochondria by means of electron microscopy. 2. The mitochondria that were the subject of this investigation were obtained from a lymphosarcoma of the rat. They were separated from the other components of the leukemic cells by a method of differential centrifugation, and thus made available for direct examination in the electron microscope. 3. In the purified form the mitochondria appeared as spherical bodies, the majority of them varying in size approximately from 0.6 to 1.3 micro in diameter. 4.

Inactivation of the purified tumor fraction with ultraviolet light depressed the absorbing power of the material, especially in the region of 2600-2500A. These changes were those which nucleic acid would present under the same conditions. 3.

While many substances are present in the alcoholic extract, the ones possessing antigenic properties are comparatively few. The latter are responsible for the antigenic properties exhibited by the whole alcoholic extract. The substances extracted with alcohol were fractionated into the following four groups. (a) Substances Insoluble in Ether and Hot Alcohol.-These are chiefly proteins and salts. The proteins are probably the minute particles of larger molecules held in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substances are removed. The water extracted from the tissues and admixed with alcohol is also an essential factor in extracting these particles in an alcoholic solution. The salts present are the usual physiological constituents of the liver, notably, sodium chloride. The quantity of these substances extracted with alcohol varies greatly with different specimens. Biologically considered, they are neither markedly hemolytic nor anticomplementary and possess no antigenic property for the Wassermann reaction. It is important, however, to note that the proteins bind complement when mixed with certain active human sera. For this reason a preparation of antigen containing this group of substances is unsuitable for use in combination with an active serum, and should, therefore, be rejected. (b) Substances Insoluble in Ether and Soluble in Hot Alcohol.-This group contains soaps, cleavage products of proteins, and small amounts of the bile salts. Soaps and bile salts are very strongly hemolytic and are absolutely unfit for use as antigen. Moreover, their antigenic properties are very slight. It is best to eliminate this group of substances from the preparation of antigen. The quantity of the substances of this group extracted from different specimens of tissue is very variable. (c) Substances Soluble in Ether, Alcohol, and Aceton.-In this group are found varying amounts of fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, some neutral fats, cholesterin and many unidentified lipoidal bodies. This group causes either hemolysis or inhibition, of hemolysis. In other words, it is anticomplementary as well as hemolytic in the majority of preparations. At the same time, in some preparations it is, to a certain extent, antigenic. This great variation in the amounts of these substances in given extracts renders their presence in the antigen preparation undesirable. It is not denied, however, that, when added in adequate quantities, some of these substances may improve the activity of the antigenic lipoids. (d) Substances Insoluble in Aceton.-This group of substances consists of phosphatids. The best known among them is, of course, lecithin. Besides lecithin, however, there must be various other phosphatids present in this fraction. It will be noticed that the precipitate formed by mixing the ethereal solution with aceton contains a certain amount of lipoids insoluble in ether as well as in alcohol. Before the fractionation in aceton, all lipoids were soluble in ether or ethyl alcohol. Further analytical work on the nature of the phosphatids contained in this fraction is necessary. This fraction, in general, is more constant in amount in the various liver extracts. Biologically considered, it is the most important. It is usually non-hemolytic, frequently anticomplementary, but much more strongly antigenic than the other fractions. The antigenic strength varies with different preparations, being almost absent in the extracts derived from fatty livers. An aceton insoluble fraction may be strongly antigenic without any other auxiliary effects, or may be accompanied by an anticomplementary property. This fraction does not cause the so-called non-specific reaction with an active human serum. For these reasons it is recommended (as Noguchi has repeatedly done before) that the antigen should be selected from the aceton-insoluble fractions. Iodine Value in Relation to Antigenic Value.-Speaking generally of the aceton-insoluble fraction, a high antigenic value is associated with a high iodine value of lipoids obtained from the liver and heart. This rule does not, however, apply to the corresponding fraction from the brain. Standard Antigen.-The preparation of a standard antigen for Noguchi's method for the diagnosis of syphilis is given just before the summary. The directions will enable one to make a stock solution, from which, at any time, a suitable antigenic emulsion may be obtained.", "pubdate_sims": "1911-01-05"}, "19870345": {"title": "PROPERTIES OF THE CAUSATIVE AGENT OF A CHICKEN TUMOR : XI.

Combined methods of fractionation have resulted in the elimination of as much as 95 per cent of the total solids of the extract as inactive constituents. Since there was some concomitant enhancement of the activity of the agent the results were equivalent to a 25-fold concentration of it in terms of dry weight. 3. The chemical content of the undiffusible fraction has been determined in terms of total nitrogen, reducing substances, sulfur, phosphorus, and lipoids. 4.

Nystagmus in the horizontal plane is evoked in fish by mechanical stimulation of the ampulla of the horizontal semicircular canal or by electrical stimulation of the nerve from this canal. The movements are conjugate and the slow phase is away from the side of stimulation. 2. Medial rectus motoneurons were recorded from intracellularly, during nystagmus. During the slow phase (induced by ipsilateral stimulation), impulses arise abruptly from the base line and appear to arise at a distance from the cell body. During the fast phase (evoked by contralateral stimulation), impulses appear to arise from large PSPs that must be generated at or near the cell body. 3. In the curarized fish, stimulation of the nerve from the contralateral horizontal canal evokes spikes that arise from large EPSPs and that are blocked relatively easily by hyperpolarizing currents. Stimulation of the nerve from the ipsilateral horizontal canal evokes spikes that arise abruptly from the base line and that are much more difficult to block by hyperpolarizing currents. Little if any underlying PSP is observed when these impulses are delayed or blocked. Thus impulses evoked by stimulation of contralateral and ipsilateral side are initiated near to and far from the cell soma, respectively. 4. If impulses evoked by contralateral stimulation fail to excite the cell body due to injury, antidromic spikes are not occluded. Thus contralateral stimulation initiates impulses in the dendrites. 5. Cell bodies of neighboring motoneurons are coupled electrotonically, and graded antidromic stimulation evokes graded depolarizing potentials which result from electrotonic spread of spike activity from adjacent neurons. These depolarizing potentials are adequate to excite the cells in the presence of a background EPSP evoked by contralateral canal stimulation. In this manner coupling tends to synchronize cells during the fast phase of the nystagmus. 6. Antidromic responses of neighboring cells fail to interact with dendritic inputs to a particular cell, although indirect evidence indicates antidromic spikes invade the impulse-initiating regions in the dendrites. Thus coupling between dendrites is negligible and dendritic inputs can mediate the smoothly graded movements of the slow nystagmic phase. Coupling between somata is too weak to cause significant interaction between dendritically evoked impulses (unless the cell bodies are depolarized by EPSPs). 7. Rhythmic firing can be recorded in a single presynaptic fiber corresponding to either the slow or the fast phase of nystagmus, but not to both. Oculomotor neurons appear to be \"relay cells\" that, during the fast phase of the nystagmus receive a synchronized synaptic input which is initiated in a higher level command nucleus.", "pubdate_sims": "1975-03"}, "5346786": {"title": "[Latency period of the muscular response after physiological stimulation of the semicircular canals in the bull-frog (Rana catesbiana)].", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1969-01-31"}, "1082224": {"title": "Experimental studies on the nerve--sensory cell relationship during degeneration and regeneration in ampullar nerves of the frog labyrinth.", "abstract": "The degeneration and regeneration of afferent and efferent nerves to the crista ampullaris in the frog were studied after transsection of the ampullar nerves.

The afferent synaptic structures in these cells were often preserved in the denervated stage. The afferent nerve fibres degenerated earlier than the efferent ones.

Vinblastine induces reversible changes of the spontaneous release of acetylcholine (ACh) at the frog neuromuscular junction as characterized by the appearance of giant potentials.

Their number, relative to the total number of spontaneous potentials, increases with the duration of soaking. 2. Large potentials appear even in the presence of tetrodotoxin or in low Ca2+-high Mg2+ Ringer solution. 3. Following vinblastine treatment,the amplitude histogram of spontaneous potentials recorded from a number of fibres display an evident periodicity with peaks occurring regularly at simple multiples of the model amplitude of the unitary potentials. It is suggested that giant potentials are produced by the release of preformed pluriquantal packets of ACh. 4. Comparison of the amplitude distribution of spontaneous potentials and end-plates potentials show that only an insignificant number of large quanta are released by nerve stimuli. The absolute frequency of giant potentials does not markedly change when spontaneous discharge is accelerated by hypertonic solution. 5.

The sensory discharges, changes in \"resting\" receptor polarization and the mass receptor potential evoked by ACh or NaCN were recorded with nonpolarizable electrodes placed across the gap. Receptor potentials and sensory discharges evoked by ACh showed an appreciable increase in amplitude and frequency when the preparation was bathed in eserinized Locke. Eserine did not change appreciably the responses evoked by NaCN. Excessive depolarization elicited by either ACh or NaCN was accompanied by sensory discharge block. Removal of K+ ions from the bathing solution induced receptor hyperpolarization and an increase in the amplitude of the evoked receptor potentials. An increase of K+ concentration had the opposite effect. Reduction of Na+ or NaCl to one half, or total removal of this salt, induced an initial reduction and later disappearance of the sensory discharges, some receptor hyperpolarization and a reduction in the amplitude of the evoked receptor potential. Reduction or removal of Ca++ produced receptor depolarization, a marked depression of the evoked receptor potentials, an increase in the frequency of the sensory discharges and a reduction in the amplitude of the nerve action potentials. High Ca++ or Mg++ had little or no effect on action potential amplitude or resting polarization, but decreased sensory discharge frequency and the evoked receptor potentials. Total or partial replacement of Ca++ with Mg++ induced complex effects: (1) receptor depolarization which occurred in low Ca++, was prevented by addition of Mg++ ions; (2) the amplitude of the evoked receptor potentials was depressed; (3) the nerve discharge frequency was reduced as it was in high Mg++ solutions; and (4) the amplitude of the nerve action potentials was reduced as it was in low Ca++ solutions. Temperature had a marked effect on the chemoreceptors since at high temperatures the receptors were depolarized and the discharge frequency increased. The baseline discharge and responses evoked by ACh or NaCN were depressed at low temperatures.

The cell body of the receptor neuron is located in the periphery and sends dendrites into a fine muscle strand. The dendrites receive innervation through an accessory nerve fiber which has now been established to be inhibitory. There exists a direct peripheral inhibitory control mechanism which can modulate the activity of the stretch receptor. The receptor cell which can be studied in isolation was stimulated by stretch deformation of its dendrites or by antidromic excitation and the effect of inhibitory impulses on its activity was analyzed. Recording was done mainly with intracellular leads inserted into the cell body. 1. Stimulation of the relatively slowly conducting inhibitory nerve fiber either decreases the afferent discharge rate or stops impulses altogether in stretched receptor cells. The inhibitory action is confined to the dendrites and acts on the generator mechanism which is set up by stretch deformation. By restricting depolarization of the dendrites above a certain level, inhibition prevents the generator potential from attaining the \"firing level\" of the cell. 2. The same inhibitory impulse may set up a postsynaptic polarization or a depolarization, depending on the resting potential level of the cell. The membrane potential at which the inhibitory synaptic potential reverses its polarity, the equilibrium level, may vary in different preparations. The inhibitory potentials increase as the resting potential is displaced in any direction from the inhibitory equilibrium. 3. The inhibitory potentials usually rise to a peak in about 2 msec. and decay in about 30 msec. After repetitive inhibitory stimulation a delayed secondary polarization phase has frequently been seen, prolonging the inhibitory action. Repetitive inhibitory excitation may also be followed by a period of facilitation. Some examples of \"direct\" excitation by the depolarizing action of inhibitory impulses are described. 4. The interaction between antidromic and inhibitory impulses was studied. The results support previous conclusions (a) that during stretch the dendrites provide a persisting \"drive\" for the more central portions of the receptor cell, and (b) that antidromic all-or-none impulses do not penetrate into the distal portions of stretch-depolarized dendrites. The \"after-potentials\" of antidromic impulses are modified by inhibition. 5. Evidence is presented that inhibitory synaptic activity increases the conductance of the dendrites.

Recording was done with intracellular leads which were inserted into the cell soma while the neuron was activated orthodromically or antidromically. The analysis was also extended to axon conduction. Crayfish, Procambarus alleni (Faxon) and Orconectes virilis (Hagen), were used. 1. The size and time course of action potentials recorded from the soma-dendrite complex vary greatly with the level of the cell's membrane potential. The latter can be changed over a wide range by stretch deformation which sets up a \"generator potential\" in the distal portions of the dendrites. If a cell is at its resting unstretched equilibrium potential, antidromic stimulation through the axon causes an impulse which normally overshoots the resting potential and decays into an afternegativity of 15 to 20 msec. duration. The postspike negativity is not followed by an appreciable hyperpolarization (positive) phase. If the membrane potential is reduced to a new steady level a postspike positivity appears and increases linearly over a depolarization range of 12 to 20 mv. in various cells. At those levels the firing threshold of the cell for orthodromic discharges is generally reached. 2. The safety factor for conduction between axon and cell soma is reduced under three unrelated conditions, (a) During the recovery period (2 to 3 msec.) immediately following an impulse which has conducted fully over the cell soma, a second impulse may be delayed, may invade the soma partially, or may be blocked completely. (b) If progressive depolarization is produced by stretch, it leads to a reduction of impulse height and eventually to complete block of antidromic soma invasion, resembling cathodal block, (c) In some cells, when the normal membrane potential is within several millivolts of the relaxed resting state, an antidromic impulse may be blocked and may set up within the soma a local potential only. The local potential can sum with a second one or it may sum with potential changes set up in the dendrites, leading to complete invasion of the soma. Such antidromic invasion block can always be relieved by appropriate stretch which shifts the membrane potential out of the \"blocking range\" nearer to the soma firing level. During the afterpositivity of an impulse in a stretched cell the membrane potential may fall below or near the blocking range. During that period another impulse may be delayed or blocked. 3. Information regarding activity and conduction in dendrites has been obtained indirectly, mainly by analyzing the generator action under various conditions of stretch. The following conclusions have been reached: The large dendrite branches have similar properties to the cell body from which they arise and carry the same kind of impulses. In the finer distal filaments of even lightly depolarized dendrites, however, no axon type all-or-none conduction occurs since the generator potential persists to a varying degree during antidromic invasion of the cell. With the membrane potential at its resting level the dendrite terminals contribute to the prolonged impulse afternegativity of the soma. 4. Action potentials in impaled axons and in cell bodies have been compared. It is thought that normally the over-all duration of axon impulses is shorter. Local activity during reduction of the safety margin for conduction was studied. 5. An analysis was made of high frequency grouped discharges which occasionally arise in cells. They differ in many essential aspects from the regular discharges set up by the generator action. It is proposed that grouped discharges occur only when invasion of dendrites is not synchronous, due to a delay in excitation spread between soma and dendrites. Each impulse in a group is assumed to be caused by an impulse in at least one of the large dendrite branches. Depolarization of dendrites abolishes the grouped activity by facilitating invasion of the large dendrite branches.", "pubdate_sims": "1955-09-20"}, "14784869": {"title": "Spike discharges of single units in the cerebellar cortex.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1950-11"}, "13303604": {"title": "[Action potentials of giant neuronic soma (Aplysia)].", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1955"}, "13124495": {"title": "Control of posture by reticular formation and cerebellum in the intract, anesthetized and unanesthetized and in the decerebrated cat.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1954-01"}, "13485327": {"title": "Intracellular records from Betz cells in the cat.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1956-01"}, "13233358": {"title": "Observations on the intracortical relations of the climbing fibers of the cerebellum; a Golgi study.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1954-12"}, "13278897": {"title": "The two routes for excitation of muscle and their subservience to the cerebellum.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1955-10-28"}, "13192660": {"title": "[Electrical response of the cerebellum of the pigeon to stimulation of the optic tract; study by microelectrodes].", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1954"}, "16994811": {"title": "The spread of activity in the cerebral cortex.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1936-11-06"}, "14946715": {"title": "The dual effect of membrane potential on sodium conductance in the giant axon of Loligo.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952-04"}, "14795439": {"title": "Depolarization of sensory terminals and the initiation of impulses in the muscle spindle.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1950-10-16"}, "13118553": {"title": "Intracellular recording from antidromically activated motoneurones.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1953-12-29"}, "12991232": {"title": "The recording of potentials from motoneurones with an intracellular electrode.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952-08"}, "14795438": {"title": "Action potentials from a sensory nerve ending.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1950-10-16"}, "13201978": {"title": "Action potentials from individual elements in cat geniculate and striate cortex.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1954-09"}, "13221671": {"title": "Neurohistological basis for the functioning of paired half-centers.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1954-10"}, "14832651": {"title": "Origin of cerebellar waves.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1951-05"}, "14918088": {"title": "[General characteristics of the cerebellar response to a volley of afferent impulses].", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1951"}, "13278905": {"title": "The specific ionic conductances and the ionic movements across the motoneuronal membrane that produce the inhibitory post-synaptic potential.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1955-11-28"}, "13278904": {"title": "The electrical properties of the motoneurone membrane.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1955-11-28"}, "13049152": {"title": "[The hypothesis of saltatory conduction].", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952"}, "13252237": {"title": "Processes of excitation in the dendrites and in the soma of single isolated sensory nerve cells of the lobster and crayfish.", "abstract": "The stretch receptor organs of Alexandrowicz in lobster and crayfish possess sensory neurons which have their cell bodies in the periphery. The cell bodies send dendrites into a fine nearby muscle strand and at the opposite pole they give rise to an axon running to the central nervous system. Mechanisms of excitation between dendrites, cell soma, and axon have been studied in completely isolated receptor structures with the cell components under visual observation. Two sensory neuron types were investigated, those which adapt rapidly to stretch, the fast cells, and those which adapt slowly, the slow cells. 1. Potentials recorded from the cell body of the neurons with intracellular leads gave resting potentials of 70 to 80 mv. and action potentials which in fresh preparations exceeded the resting potentials by about 10 to 20 mv. In some experiments chymotrypsin or trypsin was used to make cell impalement easier. They did not appreciably alter resting or action potentials. 2. It has been shown that normally excitation starts in the distal portion of dendrites which are depolarized by stretch deformation. The changed potential within the dendritic terminals can persist for the duration of stretch and is called the generator potential. Secondarily, by electrotonic spread, the generator potential reduces the resting potential of the nearby cell soma. This excitation spread between dendrites and soma is seen best during subthreshold excitation by relatively small stretches of normal cells. It is also seen during the whole range of receptor stretch in neurons in which nerve conduction has been blocked by an anesthetic. The electrotonic changes in the cells are graded, reflecting the magnitude and rate of rise of stretch, and presumably the changing levels of the generator potential. Thus in the present neurons the resting potential and the excitability level of the cell soma can be set and controlled over a wide range by local events within the dendrites. 3. Whenever stretch reduces the resting membrane potential, measured in the relaxed state in the cell body, by 8 to 12 mv. in slow cells and by 17 to 22 mv. in fast cells, conducted impulses are initiated. It is thought that in slow cells conducted impulses are initiated in the dendrites while in fast cells they arise in the cell body or near to it. In fresh preparations the speed of stretch does not appreciably influence the membrane threshold for discharges, while during developing fatigue the firing level is higher when extension is gradual. 4. Some of the specific neuron characteristics are: Fast receptor cells have a relatively high threshold to stretch. During prolonged stretch the depolarization of the cell soma is not well maintained, presumably due to a decline in the generator potential, resulting in cessation of discharges in less than a minute. This appears to be the basis of the relatively rapid adaptation. A residual subthreshold depolarization can persist for many minutes of stretch. Slow cells which resemble the sensory fibers of vertebrate spindles are excited by weak stretch. Their discharge rate remains remarkably constant for long periods. It is concluded that, once threshold excitation is reached, the generator potential within slow cell dendrites is well maintained for the duration of stretch. Possible reasons for differences in discharge properties between fast and slow cells are discussed. 5. If stretch of receptor cells is gradually continued above threshold, the discharge frequency first increases over a considerable range without an appreciable change in the firing level for discharges. Beyond that range the membrane threshold for conducted responses of the cell soma rises, the impulses become smaller, and partial conduction in the soma-axon boundary region occurs. At a critical depolarization level which may be maintained for many minutes, all conduction ceases. These overstretch phenomena are reversible and resemble cathodal block. 6. The following general scheme of excitation is proposed: stretch deformation of dendritic terminals --> generator potential --> electrotonic spread toward the cell soma (prepotential) --> dendrite-soma impulse --> axon impulse. 7. Following release of stretch a transient hyperpolarization of slow receptor cells was seen. This off effect is influenced by the speed of relaxation. 8.

The habitats in which these fishes live are relatively turbid, with the water greenish or yellowish in color. The spectral transmission of such waters is probably maximal between 520 and 570 mmicro.

It is not a porphyropsin, for bleaching revealed the presence, not of retinene(2), but of retinene(1) as a chromophore. Photolabile pigments with characteristics similar to those of the Phyllurus visual pigment were also detected in retinal extracts of six other species of nocturnal geckos. The presence of this retinal chromoprotein adequately accounts for the unusual visual sensitivity curve described by Denton for the nocturnal gecko. This pigment may have special biological significance in terms of the unique phylogenetic position of geckos as living representatives of nocturnal animals which retain some of the characteristics of their diurnal ancestors. The occurrence of this retinene(1) pigment, intermediate in spectral position between rhodopsin and iodopsin, is interpreted in support of the transmutation theory of Walls.

A succession of negative deflections, designated in order of increasing latency m, i, b, d, has been found. Each of those deflections possesses some physiological property or properties to distinguish it from the remainder. Indicated by that fact is the conclusion that the successive deflections represent impulse conduction through successive parts of the motoneurons that differ in behavior, each from the others. Since the spinal cord constitutes a volume conductor the negative deflections are anteceded by a positive deflection at all points except that at which the axonal impulses first enter from the ventral root into the spinal cord. Frequently two or more negative deflections are recorded together in overlapping sequence, but for each deflection a region can be found in which the onset of that deflection marks the transition from prodromal positivity to negativity. Deflection m is characteristic of axonal spikes. Latent period is in keeping with known axonal conduction velocity. Refractory period is brief. The response represented by m is highly resistant to asphyxia. Maximal along the line of ventral root attachment and attenuating sharply therefrom, deflection m can be attributed only to axonal impulse conduction. Deflection i is encountered only within the cord, and is always associated with a deflection b. The i,b complex is recordable at loci immediately dorsal to regions from which m is recorded, and immediately ventral to points from which b is recorded in isolation from i. Except for its great sensitivity to asphyxia, deflection i has properties in common with those of m, but very different from those of b or d. To judge by properties i represents continuing axonal impulse conduction into a region, however, that is readily depolarized by asphyxia. Deflection b possesses a unique configuration in that the ascending limb is sloped progressively to the right indicating a sharp decrease in velocity of the antidromic impulses penetrating the b segment. A second antidromic volley will not conduct from i segment to b segment of the motoneurons unless separated from the first by nearly 1 msec. longer than is necessary for restimulation of axons. This value accords with somatic refractoriness determined by other means. Together with spatial considerations, the fact suggests that b represents antidromic invasion of cell bodies. Deflection d is ubiquitous, but in recordings from regions dorsal and lateral to the ventral horn, wherein an electrode is close to dendrites, but remote from other segments of motoneurons, d is the initial negative deflection. In latency d is variable to a degree that demands that it represent slow conduction through rather elongated structures. When associated with deflection b, deflection d may arise from the peak of b with the only notable discontinuity provided by the characteristically sloped rising phase of b. Deflection d records the occupation by antidromic impulses of the dendrites. Once dendrites have conducted a volley they will not again do so fully for some 120 msec. Embracing the several deflections, recorded impulse negativity in the motoneurons may endure for nearly 5 msec. When the axonal deflection m is recorded with minimal interference from somatic currents, it is followed by a reversal of sign to positivity that endures as long as impulse negativity can be traced elsewhere, demonstrating the existence of current flow from axons to somata as the latter are occupied by impulses. Note is taken of the fact that impulse conduction through motoneurons is followed by an interval, measurable to some 120 msec., during which after-currents flow. These currents denote the existence in parts of the intramedullary motoneurons of after-potentials the courses of which must differ in different parts of the neurons, otherwise nothing would be recorded. The location of sources and sinks is such as to indicate that a major fraction of the current flows between axons and somata. For approximately 45 msec. the direction of flow is from dendrites to axons. Thereafter, and for the remaining measurable duration, flow is from axons to dendrites.", "pubdate_sims": "1951-11"}, "14861671": {"title": "Effects induced in a monosynaptic reflex path by its activation.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1951-09"}, "12986822": {"title": "[Morphology of the spinal tibialis-and peroneus nuclei in the cat:  topography, architecture, course of axons and dendrites of the motoric neurons and the intermediate neurons in the segments L6-S2].", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952"}, "15406744": {"title": "Post-tetanic potentiation of response in monosynaptic reflex pathways of the spinal cord.", "abstract": "Following tetanic afferent stimulation of a monosynaptic reflex pathway, the transmission through that pathway of isolated reflex volleys is enhanced for some minutes. Post-tetanic potentiation is comparable in the monosynaptic reflex arcs of flexor and extensor muscles. The facilitator and inhibitor actions of monosynaptic reflex afferent fibers, as well as the transmitter action, are potentiated following tetanization. Little post-tetanic change attends reflex transmission through plurisynaptic reflex arcs. Various tests for excitability change made independently of the tetanized afferent fibers reveal none or a slight depression. Hence the potentiating influence of a tetanus is limited to subsequent action on the part of the recently tetanized fibers themselves. Increase in the size of the individual impulses comprising an afferent volley such as might occur during positive after-potential, would accommodate the requirement for a limited process and provide for increased synaptic action. The proposed association between post-tetanic potentiation and positive after-potential (i.e. hyperpolarization) is supported by the following lines of evidence:- 1. Changes in intensity and duration of potentiation with change in frequency and duration of tetanic stimulation are characteristic of, and parallel to, the changes of positive after-potential in similar circumstances. 2. Afferent impulses are increased following a tetanus, and in a fashion that parallels the course of monosynaptic reflex potentiation.

Potential changes are recorded therefrom only as current flows. During the period of the after-potentials current flows in significant density only if the after-polarization differs at different points of the active neurons. Thus one does not record after-potentials in volume; one may record after-currents which are defined as the resultants of differences in after-potentials. Measurable excitability change during the period of the after-potentials, in the event no current flows, might be regarded as approximating the change of intrinsic polarization status at the region tested. In the presence of after-current flow excitability change would approximate the sum of intrinsic change and extrinsic change due to current flow. In giving rise by differences to current flow after-potentials come to act as agents, and events in one part of a neuron help to determine excitability in other parts. Since the intramedullary after-current flow is not the after-potential of the soma, it follows that ventral root electrotonus which results from axonal after-current flow cannot be considered the counterpart of somatic after-potential. Following conduction of an antidromic volley after-current flows between somata and axons. According to the signs of the recorded potential changes, after-current flow initially, and for approximately 45 msec., is in the direction from somata to axons. Thereafter, and for approximately another 75 msec., the direction of flow is reversed. During the period of after-current flow following antidromic conduction the excitability of neighboring motoneurons is altered in a manner that reproduces the phases of after-current flow. The initial phase, depression, was first described by Renshaw. The after-potentials of ventral root fibers have been studied. In a single action and in usual form, they consist of a negative after-potential of considerable magnitude and of some 35 msec. duration, and a positive after-potential detectable for approximately 120 msec. Variants and the influence of temperature change are described. The recovery cycle of ventral root axons in general compares with the after-potential cycle. Recovery of intramedullary motor axons differs from that of their extramedullary projections as ventral root fibers in a manner that is accountable to intramedullary flow of after-current. Since the intrinsic recovery process of the motoneuron somata cannot be measured in the presence of current flow it must be estimated by correcting the observed recovery for the influence of known current flows. When this is done the resultant in simplest form provides for intrinsic somatic recovery from refractoriness through a single phase of subnormality lasting some 60 msec. Conditions for the relatively undistorted recording of antidromic ventral root electrotonus are described. They include provisions that the proximal ventral root electrode must be within 12 mm. of the root-cord junction and that the distal electrode must be located in excess of 30 mm. from the distal severed end of the ventral root. Antidromic ventral root electrotonus is a counterpart of the current flows in the intramedullary stretch of the axons. Initially, during the phase of metadromal postivity of the intramedullary axons, electrotonus is negative. During the period of deflections Sp-An, that signify after-current flow into the axons, electrotonus is positive. Finally during the period of deflections Sn-Ap, that signify after-current flow outwards through the intramedullary axon membranes, electrotonus is negative.

Adaptation was modeled by a scheme in which Ca(2+) ions, entering through open transducer channels, bind at two intracellular sites to trigger independent processes leading to channel closure. It was assumed that the second site activates a modulator with 10-fold slower kinetics than the first site. The model was implemented by computing Ca(2+) diffusion within a single stereocilium, incorporating intracellular calcium buffers and extrusion via a plasma membrane CaATPase. The theoretical results reproduced several features of the experimental responses, including sensitivity to the concentration of external Ca(2+) and intracellular calcium buffer and a dependence on the onset speed of the stimulus. The model also generated damped oscillatory transducer responses at a frequency dependent on the rate constant for the fast adaptive process.

The recoil had a time course identical to adaptation of the transducer current, and like adaptation, was most prominent for small stimuli, was slowed by reducing extracellular calcium, and varied with hair cell resonant frequency.

The conductance (in 0.02 mM calcium) of MT channels from IHCs was estimated as 260 pS at both low-frequency and mid-frequency positions, whereas that from OHCs increased with CFs from 145 to 210 pS. The combination of MT channel conductance and tip link number, assayed from scanning electron micrographs, accounts for variation in whole-cell current amplitude for OHCs and its invariance for IHCs. Channels from apical IHCs and OHCs having a twofold difference in unitary conductance were both highly calcium selective but were distinguishable by a small but significant difference in calcium permeability and in their response to lowering ionic strength.

Mechano-electrical transducer currents evoked by deflections of the hair bundle were recorded in turtle isolated hair cells under whole-cell voltage clamp. The outcome of perfusing with solutions of reduced Ca2+ concentration was investigated. 2. The transducer current was roughly doubled by lowering the concentration of divalent cations from normal (2.2 mM-Mg2+, 2.8 mM-Ca2+) to 0 Mg2+, 0.5 mM-Ca2+. No significant effects on the current's kinetics or reversal potential, or on the current-displacement relationship, were noted. 3. If the Ca2+ concentration was lowered to 50 microM (with no Mg2+), there was about a threefold increase in the maximum current but other changes, including loss of adaptation and a decreased slope and negative shift in the current-displacement relationship, were also observed. As a result, more than half the peak transducer current became activated at the resting position of the hair bundle compared to about a tenth in the control solution. 4. The extra changes manifest during perfusion with 50 microM-Ca2+ had also been seen when the cell was held at positive potentials near the Ca2+ equilibrium potential. This supports the view that some consequences of reduced external Ca2+ stem from a decline in its intracellular concentration. 5. With 20 microM-Ca2+, a standing inward current developed and the cell became unresponsive to mechanical stimuli, which may be explained by the transducer channels being fully activated at the resting position of the bundle. 6. The results are interpreted in terms of a dual action of Ca2+: an external block of the transducer channel which reduces the maximum current, and an intracellular effect on the position and slope of the current-displacement relationship; the latter effect can be modelled by internal Ca2+ stabilizing one of the closed states of the channel. 7. During perfusion with 1 microM-Ca2+, the holding current transiently increased but then returned to near its control level. There was a concomitant irreversible loss of sensitivity to hair bundle displacements which we suggest is due to rupture of the mechanical linkages to the transducer channel. 8. Following treatment with 1 microM-Ca2+, single-channel currents with an amplitude of -9 pA at -85 mV were sometimes visible in the whole-cell recording. The probability of such channels being open could be modulated by small deflections of the hair bundle which indicates that they may be the mechano-electrical transducer channels or conductance about 100 pS. 9.

These structures are surmounted by a second vibrating plate that represents a tectorial structure. The analysis shows that both viscous and inertial properties of the fluid are important even at asymptotically low frequencies. The relative importance of these properties depends critically on the presence and mode of motion of the tectorial plate.

Transducer currents were recorded in turtle cochlear hair cells during mechanical stimulation of the hair bundle. The currents were measured under whole-cell voltage clamp in isolated cells that were firmly stuck to the floor of the recording chamber. 2. Stimuli were calibrated by projecting the image of the hair bundle onto a rapidly scanned 128 photodiode array. This technique showed that, while the cell body was immobilized, the tip of the bundle would follow faithfully the motion of an attached glass probe up to frequencies of more than 1 kHz. 3. The relationship between inward transducer current and bundle displacement was sigmoidal. Maximum currents of 200-400 pA were observed for deflections of the tip of the bundle of 0.5 microns, equivalent to rotating the bundle by about 5 deg. 4. In response to a step deflection of the bundle, the current developed with a time constant (about 0.4 ms for small stimuli) that decreased with the size of displacement. This suggests that the onset of the current was limited by the gating kinetics of the transduction channel. The onset time course was slowed about fourfold for a 20 degrees C drop in temperature. 5. For small maintained displacements, the current relaxed to about a quarter of the peak level with a time constant of 3-5 ms. This adaptation was associated with a shift of the current-displacement relationship in the direction of the stimulus. The rate and extent of adaptation were decreased by lowering external Ca2+. 6. Adaptation was strongly voltage sensitive, and was abolished at holding potentials positive to the reversal potential of the transducer current of about 0 mV. It was also diminished by loading cells with 10 mM of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. These observations suggest that adaptation may be partly controlled by influx of Ca2+ through the transducer channels. 7. Removal of adaptation produced asymmetric responses, with fast onsets but slow decays following return of the bundle to its resting position; the offset time course depended on both the magnitude and duration of the prior displacement. 8. In some experiments, hair bundles were deflected with a flexible glass fibre whose motion was monitored using a dual photodiode arrangement. Positive holding potentials abolished adaptation of the transducer currents, but had no influence on the time course of motion of the fibre.

The saccular neurons responded at the onset of the acceleration steps, then adapted fully within 10-50 msec. The extracellular (microphonic) response of the hair cells adapted with a similar time course, indicating that the primary sources of the neural adaptation are peripheral to the afferent synapse--in the hair cell, its mechanical inputs, or both. Evidence for hair cell adaptation was provided by 2 in vitro preparations: after excising the sacculus and removing the accessory structures, we recorded either the extracellular hair cell response to displacement of the otolithic membrane or the intracellular hair cell response to hair bundle displacement. In both cases the response to a step stimulus adapted. The adaptation involved a shift in the displacement-response curve along the displacement axis, so that the cell's operating point was reset toward the static position of its hair bundle. This displacement shift occurred in response to both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing stimuli. Its time course varied among cells, from tens to hundreds of milliseconds, and also varied with the concentration of Ca2+ bathing the apical surfaces of the hair cells.

However, the inner (IHCs) and outer (OHCs) hair cells are mechanoreceptors sharing similar general characteristics such as organization of stereocilia (including linkage system) and a gradation of stereociliary height along the length of the cochlea. This gradation of stereociliary height may be the single most important anatomic feature in the tuning capability of the sensory cell. Several lines of evidence suggest that the stereociliary stiffness may be modulated by the sensory cells themselves, most likely via the cuticular plate-rootlet complex. The stereociliary bundles of both types of hair cell are organized in a 'W' formation with a steplike arrangement. In the OHCs, the 'W' formation is sharply angulated and slanted toward the apex, coinciding with the slanted fiber arrangement of the overlying tectorial membrane, which is firmly coupled to the tips of the tallest row of the stereociliary bundles. However, in the IHCs, the 'W' formation is wide and its long axis is linear and arranged at a right angle to the radial axis of the organ of Corti; also, the ciliary bundles are freestanding (with a few exceptions in the basal turn). This arrangement in the IHCs would be best suited for deflection by the radial flow of the endolymph. Present evidence suggests that the subtectorial fluid space exists, is filled with endolymph, and freely communicates with endolymph. Because of the discovery of the phenomenon of 'cochlear emission', the possible motility of the sensory cells, particularly of the OHCs, has drawn intense interest in recent years. Recent investigations with dissociated sensory cells (OHCs) indicate some motile capability under various experimental conditions, although it has not been established that this motility is present in vivo. For this reason, the specialized cellular organization for motility and localization of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins have been investigated.

The gating property of a mechano-electrical transduction (m-e.t.) was studied in dissociated chick vestibular hair cells having hair bundles of varying length (from 7 to more than 30 microns long). The whole-cell recording voltage-clamp technique was used to record m-e.t. currents, and mechanical stimuli were applied to the hair bundle with a rigid glass rod. 2. Displacements of the glass rod and the hair bundle were measured with a resolution of 0.1 micron from contrast-enhanced television images. The motion of the hair bundle was tightly coupled to the motion of the stimulating glass rod, and displacements were not detected in the circumference of the cell body. Thus, all the displacement applied to the hair bundle resulted in bending about the insertion into the cuticle and relative to the cell body. 3. Displacements of the hair bundle towards the taller stereocilia generated inward-going m-e.t. currents at negative membrane potentials, while displacements of the hair bundle towards the shorter stereocilia generated outward-going m-e.t. currents. These outward going m-e.t. currents reflect closing of the m-e.t. channels which are open at the resting position of the hair bundle. The fraction of these channels open at the resting position was 0.12 +/- 0.04 (n = 7). 4. The displacement-response relationship measured both at -50 mV and at +38 mV were superimposable after scaling. Thus, no voltage dependence was observed in gating of the m-e.t. conductance. 5. When a hair bundle of a shorter length (less than 7.5 microns long) was stimulated at 5 micron form the insertion to the cuticle, the minimum hair-bundle displacement which could generate a detectable amount of m-e.t. current was 0.01 micron. The transduction current was linearly related to the hair-bundle displacement for values of up to 0.6 micron towards the taller stereocilia, and showed saturation with larger displacements. 6. When a hair bundle of a longer length (more than 12.5 microns long) was stimulated (towards the taller stereocilia) at 10 micron from the insertion to the cuticle the m-e.t. current generated was linear for displacements of up to 1.5 micron, and saturated with larger displacements. 7.

The longitudinal motion of the cell was measured by a differential photosensor capable of responding to motion frequencies 0-40 kHz. 3. Under voltage clamp the length change of the cell was graded with command voltage over a range +/- 2 microns (approximately 4% of the length) for cells from the apical turns of the cochlea. The mean sensitivity of the movement was 2.11 nm/pA injected current, or 19.8 nm/mV membrane polarization. 4. The kinetics of the cell length change during a voltage step were measured.

With the advent of techniques for making intracellular recordings from hair cells in the cochleas of anaesthetised mammals it has been possible to measure the responses of hair cells to acoustic stimulation and to assess their roles in sensory transduction in the cochlea. Intracellular recordings of the responses of inner and outer hair cells in the basal turn of the guinea-pig cochlea show that they differ considerably from each other. The receptor potentials of inner hair cells are larger, predominantly depolarizing to low frequency tones and at their best frequencies (16-20 kHz) they generate depolarizing dc receptor potentials. Outer hair cells generate predominantly hyperpolarizing potentials to low frequency tones. They do not produce significant voltage responses at high frequencies except at high intensities when they generate slowly rising depolarizing potentials which are associated with loss of cochlear sensitivity. At low frequencies the receptor potentials of the inner hair cells phase lead those of the outer hair cell. Measurements of their frequency selectivity show that inner and outer hair cells are both sharply tuned. It is proposed that the responses of inner and outer hair cells are consistent with sensory and motor roles respectively in mechanoelectric transduction and that the outer hair cells are the site of an active mechanical process responsible for the frequency selectivity and sensitivity of the cochlea. Intracellular recordings from hair cells in the mouse cochlea maintained in vivo have provided a direct measure of the mechanosensitivity of cochlear hair cells (approximately 30 mV per degree of displacement of their stereociliary bundles) and indirect evidence that the transfer characteristics of the outer hair cells in vivo may be due to their mechanoelectrical interaction with the tectorial membrane. This is because the transfer characteristics of the inner and outer hair cells are similar in vitro in the absence of a tectorial membrane. Considerable importance is attributed to the shape of the transfer characteristics of the inner and outer hair cells.

When the frequency of the sound stimulus was progressively increased from 100 Hz to 4 kHz, the 'periodic' (a.c.) component of the receptor potential was attenuated with respect to the 'continuous' (d.c.) component. The characteristics of the inner hair cells could be described by two stages of low-pass filtering, with one of the filters having the same corner frequency as the electrical time constants which varied in different cells between 178 and 840 Hz. Receptor potentials recorded intracellularly from two morphologically identified outer hair cells were symmetrical about the resting membrane potential (about -65-70 mV) and had a maximal amplitude of only 5 mV at frequencies and intensities which yield 20-30 mV voltage responses from inner hair cells.

The receptor potential, in response to a pure tone burst, consisted of an AC response which followed the wave form of the stimulus and was analogous to the extracellularly recorded cochlear microphonic and a depolarizating DC response which followed the envelope of the tone burst and was analogous to the extracellularly recorded summating potential. 3. The DC response was broadly tuned at high sound pressure having a maximal amplitude of 27 mV at a sound pressure level of ca. 100 db; however the bandwidth of the response was reduced at lower sound pressure level. Isoamplitude curves for the DC response were indistinguishable from the threshold curves for auditory nerve fibres. 4. The AC response was tuned in a similar fashion to the DC response except that it was attenuated at 6-9 db/octave with respect to the DC response. It is suggested that this difference was due to the effect of membrane capacitance and resistance on the AC response. In contrast the extracellularly recorded AC component was not subject to this attenuation. 5. The total resistance and capacitance in three cells were found to be 46-61 Momega and 7.8-15.8 muF respectively. 6.

The mean operating range was 1.5 micron (deflection of the tip of the bundle), approximately threefold larger than in frog saccule.

It is demonstrated that the peak shift is a universal phenomenon in the diverse cell types in this region of the cochlea.

The corresponding values of the time constants for IHCs were 10 ms and 8 ms, respectively. A displacement-dependent change in the stiffness of the hair bundle was not observed when the bundle was displaced orthogonally to the direction of excitation. The stiffness of the hair bundle as a function of nanometre displacements from the resting position was remarkably nonlinear. The stiffness declined to a minimum from the resting stiffness by about 12% for OHCs and 20% for IHCs when the hair bundle was displaced by about 20 nm in the excitatory direction, and it increased by a similar amount when the bundle was displaced by 20 nm in the inhibitory direction. The displacement at which the stiffness reached a minimum was within the most sensitive region of the hair-cell transducer function (receptor potential as a function of hair-bundle displacement), and the displacement at which the stiffness reached a maximum was at the point of saturation of the transducer function in the inhibitory direction. The nonlinear displacement-dependent compliance change is reversibly abolished, and the time constant of relaxation of the bundle for excitatory displacements is reversibly reduced, when mechanotransduction is blocked by the addition of either neomycin sulphate or cobalt chloride to the solution bathing the hair cells. The displacement-dependent compliance change was not apparently reduced when the receptor potential was attenuated through the substitution of sodium in the bathing solution with a less permeant cation, tetraethylammonium.

A round-window electrode allowed the recording of CM and computer-averaged whole-nerve action potentials (CAP). Stimulus levels and relative phase could be adjusted to yield CAPs of similar amplitude and shape to either stimulus alone. When the two stimuli were combined, the vectorial CM could be changed by about 30 db between maximum and minimum levels when delta phi was changed by 180 degrees. However, the combined CAP was relatively insensitive to delta phi.

These data are not consistent with the traditional view that basilar membrane motion underlies sensitivity and frequency discrimination, and are congruent with theories of sensitivity of hair cells or their stereocilia to direct acoustic or electric stimulation, with basilar membrane mechanical stimulation assigned some secondary role. The author offers an electromodel comprising one system of basilar membrane motion of supramolecular dimensions leading to mechanical stimulation of OHCs and their large CM, and a second parallel system excited by the same stapes displacements but of submolecular dimensions leading to a propagated acoustic wave through the cochlear partition and to acoustic----electric transduction by the tectorial membrane; the output of that membrane is picked up in the fluids of the subtectorial space by the electro-sensitive IHCs and analyzed by them in some unknown manner for frequency. These IHCs are then the sole direct precursors of neural activity. A seeming anomaly was found in that at delta phi = CM minimum, when the traditional model would predict reduced basilar membrane movement, a reduced CM, consequent reduction in neural activity, and an increase in the latency of the N1 component of the CAP, latency was in fact slightly but uniformly decreased.

In order to characterize the importance of these intracellular calcium channels in cochlear physiology, we perfused the guinea pig cochlea with antagonistic concentrations of ryanodine. The distortion products of the cochlear microphonic and the compound action potential of the auditory nerve were reversibly inhibited by ryanodine (IC(50)=27.3 microm, Hill coefficient=1.9), indicating an action at the cochlear amplifier. Single auditory nerve fibre recordings showed that ryanodine slightly increased spontaneous firing rates by 22%, suggesting an excitatory effect of ryanodine. This paradoxical effect could be explained by an inhibitory action of ryanodine on presynaptic BK channels of inner hair cells (IHC). Indeed, perfusing iberiotoxin also increased the spontaneous firing activity of the auditory nerve fibres. Furthermore, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that ryanodine inhibits BK currents at the IHC level. Conversely, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a strong expression of RyR in IHCs and, more particularly, below the cuticular plate where membranous BK channels are highly expressed.

Peripheral compression is the by-product of independent compressive processes occurring at the level of the basilar membrane, the inner hair cell (IHC), and the auditory nerve synapse. Here, an electrical-circuit equivalent of an IHC is used to look into the compression contributed by the IHC. The model includes a mechanically driven transducer potassium (K(+)) conductance and two time- and voltage-dependent basolateral K(+) conductances: one with fast and one with slow kinetics. Special attention is paid to faithfully implement the activation kinetics of these basolateral conductances. Optimum model parameters are provided to account for previously reported in vitro observations that demonstrate the compression associated with the gating of the transducer and of the basolateral channels. Without having to readjust its parameters, the model also accounts for the in vivo nonlinear IHC transfer characteristics. Model simulations are then used to investigate the relative contribution of the transducer and basolateral K(+) currents to the nonlinear IHC input/output functions in vivo. The simulations suggest that the voltage-dependent activation of the basolateral currents compresses the DC potential for stereocilia displacements above approximately 5 nm. The degree of compression exceeds 2-to-1 and is similar for all stimulation frequencies. The AC potential is compressed in a similar way, but only for frequencies below 800 Hz.

The latter reflects low-pass filtering inherent in the hair cell's basolateral membrane and calcium-dependent synaptic processes.

The time of IHC excitation (i.e., the time of chemical transmitter release) was derived from the neural recordings at near-threshold levels by applying a correction for the latency of synaptic processes and the propagation time of action potentials. 3. The phase of basilar membrane motion at the appropriate innervation site was estimated on the basis of previously measured basilar membrane responses at a location close to the basal end of the cochlea and estimates of mechanical travel time from the basal end to the innervation site, derived from the neural latencies to intense rarefaction clicks, as a function of BF. 4. The derived near-threshold excitation of basal IHCs leads basilar membrane displacement toward scala tympani by approximately 40-60 degrees. 5. At BFs corresponding to midcochlear locations (2-6 kHz) there is an abrupt phase transition. The derived excitation for IHCs located at more apical locations (BFs large in relation to stimulus frequency) corresponds approximately to peak velocity of the basilar membrane toward scala vestibuli. 6. Although the derived response phases of apically located IHCs are consistent with intracellular recordings from IHCs, the derived near-threshold response phases of basal IHCs may be inconsistent with intracellular IHC recordings. 7. The foregoing results, based on responses of nearly 1,000 cochlear afferents to tones 100-1,000 Hz at near-threshold stimulus levels, amply confirm our previous conclusions that were based on a smaller sample of responses to very low frequency tones (less than or equal to 100 Hz): there is a spatial transition at midcochlear regions in the mode of excitation of IHCs, which does not seem to simply reflect the macromechanics of the basilar membrane. 8. It has been proposed that both the paradoxical response phases of high-BF afferents and the spatial phase transition arise from an influence of cochlear microphonics on the transmembrane potential of IHCs. The present results, which show that the spatial phase transition occurs for frequencies at least as high as 400 Hz, would appear to make such an electrical influence of outer hair cells on IHCs less likely.

For frequencies up to approximately 3 kHz in the first three turns of the guinea-pig cochlea, the apical surface of the IHC and the opposing surface of the tectorial membrane were found to vibrate with similar amplitudes but opposite phases. At high frequencies, there was little relative motion between these surfaces in the transverse direction. The counterphasic motion up to approximately 3 kHz results in a pulsatile motion of the fluid surrounding the stereocilia of the IHCs. Based on physical principles of fluid flow between narrowly spaced elastic plates, we show that radial fluid motion is amplified relative to transverse membrane motion and that the radial motion is capable of bending the stereocilia.

In outer hair cells, stereocilia deflections were approximately 1/3 of the reticular lamina displacement. Smaller deflections were found in inner hair cells. The ratio between stereocilia deflection and reticular lamina displacement is important for auditory function, because it determines the stimulus applied to transduction channels.

This current was concomitant with a slow rise in [Ca2+]i (time constant, 5 s). The ATP-evoked inward currents could be repeated several times with only a small run-down in amplitude (< 10%), while the ATP-evoked Ca2+ responses showed a rapid run-down (> 80% at the third ATP application). 3. The current-voltage relationship of ATP-evoked currents showed a reversal potential at -11 +/- 6 mV (n = 8), suggesting that ATP essentially activated a non-specific cationic conductance.

Nonlinear electric conductance has been demonstrated in the basolateral membrane of the hair cell, and is commonly attributed to the presence of voltage- and time-dependent K+ conductances in this part of the hair cell membrane. To study a possible contribution of these K+ channels to the SP we perfused the perilymphatic spaces of the guinea pig cochlea with the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Since 4-AP might also affect the afferent fibers and, thus, interfere with SP measurement, we added tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the perfusion solutions to block the neuronal discharges. Sound-evoked (2-12 kHz) intracochlear potentials were recorded from the basal turn of both scala vestibuli and scala tympani. The results showed a frequency- and level-dependent effect of 4-AP on the magnitude of the SP. At low and moderate levels of 8 and 12 kHz stimuli 4-AP mostly reduced the SP amplitude, while at high levels of these stimuli and at all levels of 2 and 4 kHz stimuli 4-AP enlarged the SP amplitude. These effects were reversible and occurred in both scala vestibuli and scala tympani. We attribute these bi-directional effects on the SP amplitude to a differential effect of 4-AP on inner hair cell (IHC) and outer hair cell (OHC) physiology. The decrease in SP was found for stimulus conditions where the SP presumably depends mainly on contributions from basal turn IHCs. Blocking the 4-AP-sensitive K+ channel in the IHC membrane should lead to a reduced contribution from the IHCs to the SP, because of an increase in basolateral membrane resistance. The increase in SP was found for stimulus conditions where the SP is assumed to depend mainly on contributions from basal turn OHCs. In this case the OHCs seemed to respond to blocking of the 4-AP-sensitive K+ channel in the basolateral membrane with an increased contribution to the nonlinearity of the transduction chain.

These currents may be involved in shaping the receptor potential, implying crucial importance for the properties of afferent auditory signals. We addressed the function of BKCa by recording sound-induced responses of afferent auditory nerve (AN) fibers from mice with a targeted deletion of the pore-forming alpha-subunit of BKCa (BKalpha(-/-)) and comparing these with voltage responses of current-clamped IHCs. BKCa-mediated currents in IHCs were selectively abolished in BKalpha(-/-), whereas cochlear physiology was essentially normal with respect to cochlear sensitivity and frequency tuning.BKalpha(-/-) AN fibers showed deteriorated precision of spike timing, measured as an increased variance of first spike latency in response to tone bursts. This impairment could be explained by a slowed voltage response in the presynaptic IHC resulting from the reduced K+ conductance in the absence of BKCa. Maximum spike rates of AN fibers were reduced nearly twofold in BKalpha(-/-), contrasting with increased voltage responses of IHCs. In addition to presynaptic changes, which may be secondary to a modest depolarization of BKalpha(-/-) IHCs, this reduction in AN rates suggests a role of BKCa in postsynaptic AN neurons, which was supported by increased refractory periods.

Depolarization evoked rapid positive bundle deflections that were reduced by perfusion with the MET channel blocker dihydrostreptomycin, with no effect on the nonlinear capacitance that is a manifestation of prestin-driven somatic motility. However, the movements were also diminished by Na salicylate and depended on the intracellular anion, properties implying involvement of the prestin motor. Furthermore, depolarization of one outer hair cell caused motion of neighboring hair bundles, indicating overall motion of the reticular lamina. Depolarization of solitary outer hair cells caused cell-length changes whose voltage-activation range depended on the intracellular anion but were insensitive to dihydrostreptomycin. These results imply that both the MET channels and the somatic motor participate in hair bundle motion evoked by depolarization.

Transducer currents were recorded in turtle cochlear hair cells during mechanical stimulation of the hair bundle. The currents were measured under whole-cell voltage clamp in isolated cells that were firmly stuck to the floor of the recording chamber. 2. Stimuli were calibrated by projecting the image of the hair bundle onto a rapidly scanned 128 photodiode array. This technique showed that, while the cell body was immobilized, the tip of the bundle would follow faithfully the motion of an attached glass probe up to frequencies of more than 1 kHz. 3. The relationship between inward transducer current and bundle displacement was sigmoidal. Maximum currents of 200-400 pA were observed for deflections of the tip of the bundle of 0.5 microns, equivalent to rotating the bundle by about 5 deg. 4. In response to a step deflection of the bundle, the current developed with a time constant (about 0.4 ms for small stimuli) that decreased with the size of displacement. This suggests that the onset of the current was limited by the gating kinetics of the transduction channel. The onset time course was slowed about fourfold for a 20 degrees C drop in temperature. 5. For small maintained displacements, the current relaxed to about a quarter of the peak level with a time constant of 3-5 ms. This adaptation was associated with a shift of the current-displacement relationship in the direction of the stimulus. The rate and extent of adaptation were decreased by lowering external Ca2+. 6. Adaptation was strongly voltage sensitive, and was abolished at holding potentials positive to the reversal potential of the transducer current of about 0 mV. It was also diminished by loading cells with 10 mM of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. These observations suggest that adaptation may be partly controlled by influx of Ca2+ through the transducer channels. 7. Removal of adaptation produced asymmetric responses, with fast onsets but slow decays following return of the bundle to its resting position; the offset time course depended on both the magnitude and duration of the prior displacement. 8. In some experiments, hair bundles were deflected with a flexible glass fibre whose motion was monitored using a dual photodiode arrangement. Positive holding potentials abolished adaptation of the transducer currents, but had no influence on the time course of motion of the fibre.

With the advent of techniques for making intracellular recordings from hair cells in the cochleas of anaesthetised mammals it has been possible to measure the responses of hair cells to acoustic stimulation and to assess their roles in sensory transduction in the cochlea. Intracellular recordings of the responses of inner and outer hair cells in the basal turn of the guinea-pig cochlea show that they differ considerably from each other. The receptor potentials of inner hair cells are larger, predominantly depolarizing to low frequency tones and at their best frequencies (16-20 kHz) they generate depolarizing dc receptor potentials. Outer hair cells generate predominantly hyperpolarizing potentials to low frequency tones. They do not produce significant voltage responses at high frequencies except at high intensities when they generate slowly rising depolarizing potentials which are associated with loss of cochlear sensitivity. At low frequencies the receptor potentials of the inner hair cells phase lead those of the outer hair cell. Measurements of their frequency selectivity show that inner and outer hair cells are both sharply tuned. It is proposed that the responses of inner and outer hair cells are consistent with sensory and motor roles respectively in mechanoelectric transduction and that the outer hair cells are the site of an active mechanical process responsible for the frequency selectivity and sensitivity of the cochlea. Intracellular recordings from hair cells in the mouse cochlea maintained in vivo have provided a direct measure of the mechanosensitivity of cochlear hair cells (approximately 30 mV per degree of displacement of their stereociliary bundles) and indirect evidence that the transfer characteristics of the outer hair cells in vivo may be due to their mechanoelectrical interaction with the tectorial membrane. This is because the transfer characteristics of the inner and outer hair cells are similar in vitro in the absence of a tectorial membrane. Considerable importance is attributed to the shape of the transfer characteristics of the inner and outer hair cells. Changes in these characteristics during anoxia and following exposure to intense tones are associated with depolarization of the outer hair cells and loss of cochlear sensitivity and frequency selectivity.

Normal development and function of inner hair cells require the expression of alpha subunit 1.3 forming L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.3). Here, we used immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to study the synaptic organization and expression of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels in IHCs of mice lacking the Ca(V)1.3 Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.3(-/-)). Despite the near complete block of evoked afferent synaptic transmission, hair cell ribbon synapses were formed and remained preserved for at least 4 weeks after birth. Moreover, these \"silent\" afferent synapses held major components of the synaptic machinery such as Bassoon, Piccolo, and CSP. Hence, the block of exocytosis might be solely attributed to the lack of Ca(2+) influx through Ca(V)1.3 channels. Later on, Ca(V)1.3 deficient IHCs subsequently lost their afferent synapses. This was probably due to a secondary degeneration of the postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons. In line with a prolonged efferent synaptic transmission onto Ca(V)1.3 deficient IHCs, which normally ceases around onset of hearing, we found juxtaposed immunoreactive spots of efferent presynaptic synaptophysin and postsynaptic (IHCs) small conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels (SK channels) up to six weeks after birth. Finally, we show a substantial reduction of mRNA for the alpha subunit of the large conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel (BK) in the apical cochlea, suggesting a reduced transcription of its gene in Ca(V)1.3 deficient IHCs. Ca(V)1.3 deficient IHCs lacked the apical spot-like immunoreactivity of clustered BK channels, which normally contribute to the temporal precision of hair cell afferent synaptic transmission. In summary, these data indicate that the Ca(V)1.3 channels are crucially involved in regulation of the expression of BK and SK channels.

We present a mathematical model of the hair cell which demonstrates that the combination of these two mechanisms can produce \"self-tuned critical oscillations\", i.e., maintain the hair bundle at the threshold of an oscillatory instability. The characteristic frequency depends on the geometry of the bundle and on the Ca(2+) dynamics, but is independent of channel kinetics.

The receptor potentials recorded from inner hair cells are asymmetrical about the resting membrane potential with the depolarizing phase, which corresponds to rarefaction in sound pressure, exceeding the phase of hyperpolarization by a factor of about 3. It was found that the relationship between the peak-to-peak voltage responses and sound pressure level could be described by rectangular hyperbolae. When the frequency of the sound stimulus was progressively increased from 100 Hz to 4 kHz, the 'periodic' (a.c.) component of the receptor potential was attenuated with respect to the 'continuous' (d.c.) component. The characteristics of the inner hair cells could be described by two stages of low-pass filtering, with one of the filters having the same corner frequency as the electrical time constants which varied in different cells between 178 and 840 Hz. Receptor potentials recorded intracellularly from two morphologically identified outer hair cells were symmetrical about the resting membrane potential (about -65-70 mV) and had a maximal amplitude of only 5 mV at frequencies and intensities which yield 20-30 mV voltage responses from inner hair cells. No d.c. component receptor potentials were recorded in response to high-frequency tones. Phase and amplitude measurements were made from receptor potentials from inner hair cells, and from 'cochlear microphonic potentials' which were recorded from the organ of Corti and scala tympani. The phase of depolarization in both potentials was associated with displacement of the basilar membrane towards the scala vestibuli. The phase of the intracellular receptor potentials leads the cochlear microphonic by about 90 degrees and the sound pressure by about 180 degrees at frequencies below 100 Hz. Above this frequency the phase lead progressively declines and at higher frequencies becomes a phase lag. These phase relationships indicate that inner hair cells respond to the velocity of the basilar membrane at frequencies below 200-600 Hz, and to its displacement above this, and that the voltage responses of the inner hair cells are limited by their membrane time constants. It is suggested that outer hair cells respond to basilar membrane displacement throughout their frequency range. It is shown that, with respect to frequency, the different growth rates of the cochlear microphonic potentials and inner hair cell receptor potentials, and the dominance of cochlear microphonic potentials in the organ of Corti, result in an effective electrical interaction between inner hair cells and cochlear microphonic potentials.", "pubdate_sims": "1983-05"}, "9481679": {"title": "Calcium permeation of the turtle hair cell mechanotransducer channel and its relation to the composition of endolymph.", "abstract": "1. Recordings of mechanoelectrical transducer currents were combined with calcium imaging of hair bundles in turtle auditory hair cells located near the high-frequency end of the cochlea. The external face of the hair bundles was perfused with a range of Ca2+ concentrations to study the quantitative relationship between Ca2+ influx and transducer adaptation. 2. With Na+ as the monovalent ion, the peak amplitude of the transducer current decreased monotonically as the external [Ca2+] was raised from 25 microns to 20 mm. When Na+ was replaced with the impermeant Tris the transducer current increased with external [Ca2+]. These results indicate that Ca2+ can both permeate and block the transducer channels. The Ca2+ concentration for half-block of the monovalent current was 1 mm. 3. To quantify the Ca2+ influx, the fraction of transducer current carried by Ca2+ was measured using the change in bundle fluorescence in cells loaded with 1 mm Calcium Green-1. The fluorescence change was calibrated by substituting an impermeable monovalent ion to render Ca2+ the sole charge carrier. 4. In the presence of Na+, the fractional Ca2+ current was approximately 10% in 50 microns Ca2+, a concentration similar to that in endolymph, which bathes the hair bundles in vivo. The amount of Ca2+ entering was dependent on the identity of the monovalent ion, and was larger with K+, suggesting that the transducer channel is a multi-ion pore. 5. Over a range of ionic conditions, the rate of transducer adaptation was proportional to Ca2+ influx indicating that adaptation is driven by a rise in intracellular [Ca2+]. 6. Shifts in the current-displacement function along the displacement axis in different external Ca2+ concentrations were predictable from variation in the resting Ca2+ influx. We suggest that changes in the resting open probability of the transducer channels adjust the entry of Ca2+ to keep its concentration constant at an internal site. 7. The results demonstrate that endolymph containing high K+, 50 microns Ca2+ and low Mg2+ concentrations, maximizes the transducer current while still allowing sufficient Ca2+ entry to drive adaptation. The hair cell mechanotransducer channel, in its permeation and block by Ca2+, shows behaviour similar to the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel and the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel.", "pubdate_sims": "1998-01-01"}, "15664704": {"title": "Localization and developmental expression of BK channels in mammalian cochlear hair cells.", "abstract": "The expression of Slo channels (alpha subunits of BK channels) was investigated in the developing mouse cochlea using a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal part of the protein (residues 1098-1196). The first BK channel immunoreactivity was observed in the cochlea at E18, where it was localized within the cytoplasm of cells lining the area of the organ of Corti and the spiral ganglion. There was an increase of immunoreactivity in all cells bordering the scala media (supporting and hair cells of the organ of Corti, the stria vascularis and the Reissner's membrane) in the following stages (postnatal day [P] 0 and P6). From P12 to adult, a strong membranous labeling, increasing with age, appeared in inner hair cells. The distribution of BK channels was mainly observed as dense elongated plaques localized in the lateral membrane below the cuticular plate. In addition, a more discrete immunolabeling for BK channels, as punctuated dots, was observed in the synaptic area of inner hair cells. This dual localization of BK channels within inner hair cells was confirmed by a different technique using a fluorescently labeled high-affinity ligand of these channels: IbTX-D19C-Alexa488. We demonstrated under patch clamp experiments that this fluorescent toxin conserved its native property, i.e. to reversibly inhibit BK currents in isolated inner hair cells. The fluorescent toxin, both in living or fixed tissues, also showed a preferential binding to mature inner hair cells with a similar subcellular distribution described above using immunocytochemical technique. Overall, our present results confirm the appearance of membranous BK channels around P12 in mouse inner hair cells, an age at which the auditory system becomes functional. The expression of BK channels in mature inner hair cells, near the site of mechanical-transduction, might serve to limit receptor potential attenuation due to the space constant, and thus permitting these sensory cells to function as fast and sensitive transducers.", "pubdate_sims": "2005"}, "8793083": {"title": "Development of the auditory receptors of the rat: a SEM study.", "abstract": "Fetal and postnatal ontogenesis of the rat cochlea, from the 16th gestational day (16DG) until 3 months post partum, were studied using scanning electron microscopy with emphasis on the stereocilia during the earliest stages of development. The epithelium of the cochlear duct in 16DG rat consisted of plygonal cells topped with numerous microvilli and one central kinocilium, which form the so-called K\u00f6lliker's organ. Inner hair cells (IHCs) appeared at 18DG in the basal cochlea. They were characterized by tufts of cilia of the same height and with a kinocilium. The first outer hair cells (OHCs) can be seen at 20DG. The earliest stages of ciliary differentiation, at 18DG for IHCs and 20DG for OHCs, were similar on both types of cells and were characterized by the presence of round bundles of cilia arising from the surrounding microvilli. A three-dimensional V-shaped organization for OHCs and the linear arrangement for IHCs appeared by the end of the first postnatal week, accompanied by the disappearance of transient cilia on the modiolar side of the hair cell and the kinocilium on the external side. The apical pole of OHCs reached adult-like morphology before that of IHCs. Various links between stereocilia were detected already at birth. Morphometric analysis showed that auditory cells from the base of the cochlea reached adult size by the end of the first postnatal week while those from the apex increased their size later. A review of the literature including comparative observations across species on the ontogenesis of the stereocilia shows that hair cells of the stato-acoustic system may present the same early ontogenesis.", "pubdate_sims": "1996-05-20"}, "6179918": {"title": "Intracellular and extracellular responses in the organ of Corti of the gerbil.", "abstract": "Techniques have been developed for recording from and staining cells in the organ of Corti of the Mongolian gerbil. Using physiological criteria as in the guinea pig, the cells were classified as either supporting cells or inner hair cells (IHCs). In addition, several IHCs were stained using HRP and identified in surface preparations. Extracellular responses in the vicinity of IHCs were tuned as sharply as auditory-nerve fibers. Intracellular tuning curves of IHCs were equally sharp near their tips. However, the tip-to-tail distances and sensitivities appeared to be somewhat reduced, presumably due to trauma caused by the recording electrode. Intensity functions, relating receptor depolarization to stimulus intensity level, were obtained for the IHCs. The functions have a consistent quantitative form for frequencies equal to or less than the characteristic frequency of a cell. At low stimulus levels the response increases in proportion to energy, i.e. the square of the sound pressure level. At high levels the response increases more slowly, but shows a greater operating range, and smaller effects of saturation, than do the steady-state responses of single auditory-nerve fibers.",

protective mechanism for xenobiotics, such as bp, that may escape the primary placental screen. the recently described role of vitamin k-dependent gla protein as ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, also establishes k as a link in cell growth and transformation. it is proposed that the small total body pool of k1 in the adult, which is sufficient only to meet continuing needs, and the even

While covalent adduction of DNA appears to be essential for tumor initiation, little is known about the binding of carcinogens to the DNA of fetal tissues. A sensitive 32P-postlabeling method enabled us to study the binding of the environmental carcinogens safrole (600 mumol/kg p.o.), 4-aminobiphenyl (800 mumol/kg), and benzo(a)pyrene (200 mumol/kg) to the DNA of various maternal and fetal tissues after administration of test carcinogens to pregnant ICR mice on day 18 of gestation. The results show that these carcinogens bound to the DNA of maternal and fetal liver, lung, kidney, heart, brain, intestine, skin, maternal uterus, and placenta, with organ-specific quantitative and qualitative differences. It was possible for the first time to analyze DNA adduct patterns in minute amounts of tissue, for example those available from fetal heart. The covalent binding index (mumol adducted nucleotides per mol of DNA nucleotides/mumol carcinogen administered per g body weight) 24 h after safrole treatment was estimated for the different organs and ranged from 0.1 to 247 and 0.1 to 5.8 for maternal and fetal DNA, respectively. Covalent binding index values of 0.2 to 13 and 0.1 to 0.3 for maternal and fetal DNA, respectively, were found for 4-aminobiphenyl. Benzo(a)pyrene treatment yielded covalent binding index values of 0.6 to 6.5 and 0.3 to 0.7 for maternal and fetal DNA, respectively. In both maternal and fetal tissues, safrole exhibited preferential binding to liver DNA. 4-Aminobiphenyl bound preferentially to DNA of maternal liver and kidney but showed no preference among fetal tissues. Benzo(a)pyrene exhibited weak tissue preference in both maternal and fetal organs. For all of the compounds studied, the fetal adduct levels were generally lower than the corresponding maternal adduct levels, especially when the level of maternal adduction was high. The major finding was that several carcinogens of diverse structure or their metabolites readily crossed the placenta and gave rise to DNA adducts in fetal organs.

Immunoaffinity chromatography columns, conjugated with monoclonal antibodies raised against benzo(a)-pyrene-diol-epoxide-deoxyguanosine, were used to concentrate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducted nucleotides, and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy was used specifically to detect r-7,t-8,t-9,c-10-tetrahydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene (BP-tetrol) extracted from acid hydrolysates of immunoconcentrated materials. Data were analyzed for associations with maternal dietary and smoking habits, umbilical cord blood cotinine levels, and placental aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase levels. Complex mixtures of fluorescent materials were present in organic solvent extracts of acid hydrolysates of immunoconcentrated nucleotide-adducts from all placentas with patterns of fluorescence that may be associated with tobacco smoking determined by generation of spectral fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. BP-tetrols were detected in extracts from 8 placentas: 5 of 7 from smokers and 3 of 9 from nonsmokers.

This association was independent of maternal smoking or umbilical cord blood cotinine levels. These results indicate that while maternal tobacco smoking is associated with the accumulation of putative, but as yet unidentified, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts in placenta, metabolic capacity appears to be the principal determinant for the (+/-)r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-c-9,10 epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene-DNA adduct levels detected.", "pubdate_sims": "1992-03-15"}, "6304144": {"title": "Vitamin K as a regulator of benzo(a)pyrene metabolism, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis.

Vitamin K3 also inhibits benzo(a)pyrene metabolism in rat liver fragments and reduces its mutagenicity in the Ames test. Higher concentrations of vitamin K3 are required to comparably reduce benzo(a)pyrene metabolism when the microsomal system has been induced with 3-methylcholanthrene. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the products of benzo(a)pyrene metabolism shows a uniform reduction of all the metabolic products. When tumors were induced in ICR/Ha female mice by the intraperitoneal injection of benzo(a)pyrene, those mice given vitamin K3 before or both before and after benzo(a)pyrene had a slower rate of tumor appearance and tumor death rate as compared with those receiving benzo(a)pyrene alone. However, vitamin K1 increased the rate of tumor death while vitamin K deprivation and warfarin decreased the rate of tumor appearance and death in benzo(a)pyrene-injected mice. These studies indicate that vitamin K3 is an inhibitor of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and reduces the carcinogenic and mutagenic metabolites in vitro, and inhibits benzo(a)pyrene tumorigenesis in vivo. That vitamin K1 enhances the benzo(a)pyrene effect while warfarin and vitamin K deficiency inhibit benzo(a)pyrene tumorigenesis indicates that vitamin K1, vitamin K deprivation, or possibly blockade of its metabolic cycle also modulates benzo(a)pyrene metabolism in vivo but by a mechanism or at a site different from the vitamin K3 effect.

The specific activity for the formation of 9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene was higher at high microsomal enzyme concentration.

The relatively constant specific activity for the formation of 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene with several enzyme concentrations suggests that the K-region epoxide, benzo(a)pyrene-4,5-oxide, is the most stable of the benzo(a)pyrene epoxide intermediates.

The umu response is correlated to levels of microsomal cytochrome P-450NF (P-450NF) and nifedipine oxidation in different human liver samples used for activation, and both the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of B(a)P-7,8-diol gave similar results in these and other assays. The microsomal umu response was inhibited by antibodies raised against P-450NF. 7,8-Benzoflavone stimulated the B(a)P-7,8-diol-dependent umu response observed with purified P-450NF and human liver and lung microsomes.

Bony defects were not a feature of prenatal exposure to warfarin. These results show that prenatal exposure of the rat to warfarin and vitamin K duplicates the hemorrhagic abnormalities and pathology associated with prenatal exposure to warfarin in the human.

Dietary factors are important in the regulation of drug metabolism in animals and man. Feeding rats brussels sprouts or cabbage stimulates the intestinal and hepatic metabolism of drugs in animals. This effect is caused, at least in part, by certain indoles normally present in these vegetables.

High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of the metabolism of BP in rat epidermal microsomes revealed substantial inhibition of metabolite formation by clotrimazole.

Furthermore, a single topical application of clotrimazole resulted in 80 and 30% induction of epidermal and hepatic glutathione S-transferase activity, respectively. Topical application of clotrimazole to the skin of BALB/c mice substantially increased the latent period for the development of skin tumors by 3-methylcholanthrene. These studies indicate that clotrimazole is an extremely potent inhibitor of epidermal BP metabolism and of the DNA-binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogens, and is an enhancer of enzymes necessary for detoxification of the PAH.

The large majority of the studies performed have dealt with the cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal mono-oxygenase systems and for several of the common drug metabolising reactions, very little or no data are available at this time. Some of the more important data that have emerged include observations that important bioactivation reactions can be demonstrated in human fetal tissues obtained during the period of late embryogenesis (high susceptibility to chemical dysmorphogenesis) and that the human fetal adrenal gland possesses considerable capacity to catalyse several important oxidation-reduction reactions. From the data available to date, it would appear that, in most instances, the biotransformation of drugs in the human embryo and fetus would not affect maternal plasma concentrations significantly. From the viewpoint of parameters of the pharmacokinetics of parent drug (or other xenobiotic) substrates under steady-state conditions, human fetal drug metabolism probably is of little consequence in most cases, although exceptions may exist. Pharmacokinetic parameters observed after isolated exposure, however, are very likely to be affected, perhaps markedly, in some instances. The demonstrated capacity of human prenatal tissues and cells to generate reactive intermediary metabolites, including those that produce mutations, has attracted the greatest attention recently. This capacity may be associated with extremely important adverse reactions to drugs and other environmental chemicals. Such adverse responses include transplacental mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, dysmorphogenesis, and perhaps several other undesirable effects. Although far from conclusive, the data tend to suggest that humans and subhuman primates may be more vulnerable than the smaller common experimental animals to the toxic effects of foreign organic chemicals during prenatal life.

while sodium nitroprusside increased guanylate cyclase activity in most of the preparations examined, the effects of sodium azide, hydroxylamine and nitroglycerin were tissue specific. nitroglycerin and hydroxylamine were also less potent. neither the protein activator factor nor catalase which is required for sodium azide effects altered the stimulatory effect of sodium nitroprusside. in the presence of sodium azide, sodium nitroprusside or hydroxylamine, magnesium ion was as effective as manganese ion as a sole cation cofactor for guanylate cyclase. with soluble guanylate cyclase from rat liver and bovine tracheal smooth muscle the concentrations of sodium nitroprusside that gave half-maximal stimulation with mn2+ were 0.1 mm and 0.01 mm, respectively. effective concentrations were slightly less with mg2+ as a sole cation cofactor. the ability of these agents to increase cyclic gmp levels in intact tissues is probably due to their effects on guanylate cyclase activity. while the precise mechanism of guanylate cyclase activation by these agents is not known, activation may be due to the formation of nitric oxide or another reactive material since nitric oxide also increased

A gradation in steady-state cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels was observed in incubated slices of these tissues (inner medula greater than outer medulla greater than cortex). This correlated with the proportion of total guanyl cyclase activity in the 100 000 g particulate fraction of each tissue, but was discordant with the relative activities of guanylate cyclase (highest in cortex) and of cGMP-phosphodiesterase (lowest in cortex) in whole tissue homogenates. Soluble guanylate cyclase of cortex and inner medulla exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km for MnGTP of 0.11 mM, while the particulate enzyme from inner medulla exhibited apparent positive cooperative behavior and a decreased dependence on Mn2+. Thus, the particulate enzyme could play a key role in regulating cGMP levels inthe intact cell where Mn2+ concentrations are low. The soluble and particulate enzymes from inner medulla were further distinguished by their responses to several test agents. The soluble enzyme was activated by Ca2+, NaN3, NaNo2 and phenylhydrazine, whereas particulate activity was inhibited by Ca2+ and was unresponsive to the latter agents. In the presence of NaNo2, Mn2+ requirement of the soluble enzyme was reduced and equivalent to that of the particulate preparation. Moreover, relative responsiveness of the sollble enzyme to NaNO2 was potentiated when Mg2+ replaced Mn2+ as the sole divalent cation. These changes in metal requirements may be involved in the action of NaNO2 to increase cGMP in intact kidney.

By chromatography on Sepharose 2B, before and after preincubation, it was demonstrated that the increase in activity was only associated with the soluble guanylate cyclase, and not the particulate enzyme. Activation by preincubation required O2. It was completely inhibited by thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and by bovine serum albumin, KCN, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. These inhibitors suggested a copper requirement for activation, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that 20 to 60 muM CuCl2 could relieve the inhibition by 0.1 mM sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. 2-Mercaptoethanol inhibition could also be reversed by removal of the thiol on a Sephadex G-25 column, however, this treatment partially activated the enzyme. Addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a preincubated preparation would not reverse the activation. H2O2 was found to activate guanylate cyclase, either by its generation in the lung supernatant with glucose oxidase and glucose, or by its addition to a preparation in which the catalase was inhibited with KCN. KCN or bovine serum albumin was able to partially inhibit activation by glucose oxidase plus glucose, however, larger amounts of glucose oxidase could overcome that inhibition, indicating a catalytic role for Cu2+ at low H2O2 concentrations. No direct evidence for H2O2 formation during preincubation could be found, however, indirect evidence was obtained by the spectrophotometric detection of choleglobin formation from hemoglobin present in the lung supernatant fluid.

The mitochondrial fraction of cerebral cortex activated guanylate cyclase in supernatant of brain, liver, or kidney in the presence of hydroxylamine. The mitochondrial fraction prepared from liver or kidney, in turn, activated soluble guanylate cyclase in brain. Activation of guanylate cyclase by hydroxylamine was compared with that of sodium azide. Azide activated guanylate cyclase in the synaptosomal soluble fraction, while hydroxylamine inhibited it. The particulate fraction preincubated with azide followed by washing did not stimulate guanylate cyclase activity in the absence of azide. The activation of guanylate cyclase by hydroxylamine is not due to a change in the concentration of the substrate GTP, Addition of hydroxylamine did not alter the apparent Km value of guanylate cyclase for GTP.

Their pH optima were pH 7.4, both enzymes were inhibited by ATP, dATP, dGTP and ITP, required Mn2+ for activity and plots of activity versus Mn2+ concentration were sigmoidal.

Increases in cGMP were maximal in response to these concentrations of the agonists and occurred within 2 min. Exclusion of Ca2+ from the incubation media reduced basal cGMP by 50% in 20 min and abolished responses to carbamylcholine and NaF, while exclusion of Mg2+ was without effect. Analogous reductions in cGMP were observed in complete buffer containing 1 mM tetracaine, an agent which blocks movement of Ca2+ across and binding to biologic membranes. By contrast, exclusion of Ca2+ or addition of tetracaine did not alter relative cGMP responses to NaN3 (6-fold increase over basal), although levels were reduced in slices exposed to these buffers for 20 min. When slices were incubated without Ca2+ or with tetracaine for only 2 min prior to addition of agonists, basal cGMP did not decline.

Under a variety of assay conditions where responses to NaN3 were readily detectable, alterations in guanylate cyclase activities could not be demonstrated in response to carbamylcholine or NaF. By contrast Ca2+ increased the guanylate cyclase activity 6- to 7-fold over basal under conditions of reduced Mn2+ (0.75 mM Mn2+/1 mM GTP).

After incubation for 1 h in nutrient-deficient media, a few spherical bodies appeared in the vacuoles and moved actively by Brownian movement. These bodies gradually increased in number and after 3 h they filled the vacuoles almost completely. During their accumulation, the volume of the vacuolar compartment also increased. Electron microscopic examination showed that these bodies were surrounded by a unit membrane which appeared thinner than any other intracellular membrane. The contents of the bodies were morphologically indistinguishable from the cytosol; these bodies contained cytoplasmic ribosomes, RER, mitochondria, lipid granules and glycogen granules, and the density of the cytoplasmic ribosomes in the bodies was almost the same as that of ribosomes in the cytosol.

In the presence of PMSF, wild-type cells accumulated autophagic bodies in the vacuoles under nutrient-deficient conditions in the same manner as did multiple protease-deficient mutants or cells with a disrupted PRB1 gene. As the autophagic bodies disappeared rapidly after removal of PMSF from cultures of normal cells, they must be an intermediate in the normal autophagic process.

To evaluate the impact these vpt mutations have on the biogenesis and functioning of the lysosome-like vacuole, we have used light and electron microscopic techniques to analyze the vacuolar morphology in the mutants. These observations have permitted us to assign the vpt mutants to three distinct classes. The class A vpt mutants (26 complementation groups) contain 1-3 large vacuoles that are morphologically indistinguishable from those in the parental strain, suggesting that only a subset of the proteins destined for delivery to this compartment is mislocalized. One class A mutant (vpt13) is very sensitive to low pH and exhibits a defect in vacuole acidification. Consistent with a potential role for vacuolar pH in protein sorting, we found that bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase, as well as the weak base ammonium acetate and the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, collapse the pH gradient across the vacuolar membrane and cause the missorting and secretion of two vacuolar hydrolases in wild-type cells. Mutants in the three class B vpt complementation groups exhibit a fragmented vacuole morphology. In these mutants, no large normal vacuoles are observed. Instead, many (20-40) smaller vacuole-like organelles accumulate. The class C vpt mutants, which constitute four complementation groups, exhibit extreme defects in vacuole biogenesis. The mutants lack any organelle resembling a normal vacuole but accumulate other organelles including vesicles, multilamellar membrane structures, and Golgi-related structures. Heterozygous class C zygotes reassemble normal vacuoles rapidly, indicating that some of the accumulated aberrant structures may be intermediates in vacuole formation. These class C mutants also exhibit sensitivity to osmotic stress, suggesting an osmoregulatory role for the vacuole.

The alpha-latrotoxin receptor seems to be exclusively at the presynaptic plasmamembrane. Here we report that the alpha-latrotoxin receptor specifically binds to a synaptic vesicle protein, synaptotagmin, and modulates its phosphorylation. Synaptotagmin is a synaptic vesicle-specific membrane protein that binds negatively charged phospholipids and contains two copies of a putative Ca(2+)-binding domain from protein kinase C (the C2-domain), suggesting a regulatory role in synaptic vesicle fusion.

In the current study, we have investigated the biochemical properties of synaptotagmin, demonstrating that it contains five protein domains: an intravesicular amino-terminal domain that is glycosylated but lacks a cleavable signal sequence; a single transmembrane region; a sequence separating the transmembrane region from the two repeats homologous to protein kinase C; the two protein kinase C-homologous repeats; and a conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence following the two repeats homologous to protein kinase C. Sucrose density gradient centrifugations and gel electrophoresis indicate that synaptotagmin monomers associate into dimers and are part of a larger molecular weight complex. A sequence predicted to form an amphipathic alpha-helix that may cause the stable dimerization of synaptotagmin is found in its third domain between the transmembrane region and the protein kinase C-homologous repeats. Synaptotagmin contains a single hypersensitive proteolytic site that is located immediately amino-terminal to the amphipathic alpha-helix, suggesting that synaptotagmin contains a particularly exposed region as the peptide backbone emerges from the dimer. Finally, subcellular fractionation and antibody bead purification demonstrate that synaptotagmin co-purifies with synaptophysin and other synaptic vesicle markers in brain. However, in the adrenal medulla, synaptotagmin was found in both synaptophysin-containing microvesicles and in chromaffin granules that are devoid of synaptophysin, suggesting a shared role for synaptotagmin in the exocytosis of small synaptic vesicles and large dense core catecholaminergic vesicles.", "pubdate_sims": "1991-01-05"}, "1840599": {"title": "Structural and functional conservation of synaptotagmin (p65) in Drosophila and humans.", "abstract": "Synaptotagmin (p65) is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein that contains two copies of a sequence that is homologous to the regulatory region of protein kinase C.

The two internal repeats of synaptotagmin are only slightly more homologous to each other than to protein kinase C, and the differences between the repeats are conserved in evolution, suggesting that they might not be functionally equivalent. The cytoplasmic domains of human and Drosophila synaptotagmins produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli specifically bound phosphatidylserine similar to rat synaptotagmin. They also hemagglutinated trypsinized erythrocytes at nanomolar concentrations. Hemagglutination was inhibited both by negatively charged phospholipids and by a recombinant fragment from rat synaptotagmin that contained only a single copy of the two internal repeats. Together these results demonstrate that synaptotagmin is highly conserved in evolution compatible with a function in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles at the active zone. The similarity of the phospholipid binding properties of the cytoplasmic domains of rat, human, and Drosophila synaptotagmins and the selective conservation of the sequences that are homologous to protein kinase C suggest that these are instrumental in phospholipid binding.

RNA blots demonstrate complementary patterns of expression for synaptotagmins I and II, with synaptotagmin I preferentially expressed in rostral, phylogenetically younger brain regions, and synaptotagmin II predominantly expressed in caudal, phylogenetically older brain regions.

single disulphide bond (Fig. 1). The heavy chain (M(r) 100,000 (100K)) is responsible for specific binding to neuronal cells and cell penetration of the light chain (50K), which blocks neurotransmitter release. Several lines of evidence have recently suggested that clostridial neurotoxins could be zinc endopeptidases. Here we show that tetanus and botulinum toxins serotype B are zinc endopeptidases, the activation of which requires reduction of the interchain disulphide bond. The protease activity is localized on the light chain and is specific for synaptobrevin, an integral membrane protein of small synaptic vesicles. The rat synaptobrevin-2 isoform is cleaved by both neurotoxins at the same single site, the peptide bond Gln 76-Phe 77, but the isoform synaptobrevin-1, which has a valine at the corresponding position, is not cleaved. The blocking of neurotransmitter release of Aplysia neurons injected with tetanus toxin or botulinum toxins serotype B is substantially delayed by peptides containing the synaptobrevin-2 cleavage site. These results indicate that tetanus and botulinum B neurotoxins block neurotransmitter release by cleaving synaptobrevin-2, a protein that, on the basis of our results, seems to play a key part in neurotransmitter release.", "pubdate_sims": "1992-10-29"}, "1356988": {"title": "Tetanus toxin and botulinum toxins type A and B inhibit glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, aspartate, and met-enkephalin release from synaptosomes.

The toxins preferentially attenuate a slow phase of KCl-evoked glutamate release which may be associated with synaptic vesicle mobilization. Tetanus toxin additionally inhibits the release of aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid and met-enkephalin from the same preparation. Since amino acids and neuropeptides are released by distinct mechanisms, this indicates that the toxin affects a step common to both exocytotic pathways. When Ba2+ (which does not interact with calmodulin) is substituted for Ca2+, the control KCl-evoked release of each transmitter is unaffected and tetanus toxin is still inhibitory.

Tetanus toxin inhibited potassium-evoked release of [3H]glycine and [3H]glutamate in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Ninety minutes after the application of toxin (6 x 10(-10) M), the stimulated release of [3H]glycine was blocked completely, whereas stimulated release of [3H]glutamate was not blocked completely until 150-210 min after toxin application. Fragment C, the binding portion of the tetanus toxin molecule, had no effect on stimulated release of either transmitter. The spontaneous synaptic release of [3H]glycine was blocked totally within 90 min of toxin exposure. In contrast, the spontaneous release of [3H]glutamate, in toxin-exposed cultures, was elevated to nearly twice that of control cultures at this time. Thus, toxin-induced convulsant activity is characterized by a reduction in the spontaneous synaptic release of inhibitory neurotransmitter with a concomitant increase in the release of excitatory neurotransmitter, as well as the more rapid onset of blockade of depolarization-evoked release of inhibitory versus excitatory neurotransmitter.", "pubdate_sims": "1992-12"}, "1361727": {"title": "Tetanus toxin action: inhibition of neurotransmitter release linked to synaptobrevin proteolysis.", "abstract": "Tetanus toxin is a potent neurotoxin that inhibits the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic nerve endings.

We then generated specific 5'- and 3'-deletion mutants of the L chain genes of TeTx and BoNT/A and tested the biological properties of the gene products by microinjection of the corresponding mRNAs into identified presynaptic cholinergic neurons of the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica.

A deletion of 8 amino-terminal or 32 carboxyl-terminal residues from the L chain had no effect on toxicity, whereas a removal of 10 amino-terminal or 57 carboxyl-terminal amino acids abolished toxicity. 4) The synergistic effect mediated by the H chain is linked to the carboxyl-terminal portion of the H chain, as demonstrated by injection of HC-specific mRNA into neurons containing the L chain.

The reverse was true for TeTx or a mixture its constituent chains. Such selectivity was assigned to differences in neuronal targetting and uptake of the neurotoxins since both exhibited similar potencies when injected directly into the cell body of either cell type. When bath-applied, heterologous combinations of the toxins' HC and LC appeared as effective as the parent neurotoxins from whence each HC was derived. Moreover, targetting/internalization was attributable to the analogous N-terminal moieties, H2 and beta 2, of the HC from BoNT A and TeTx. Thus, it may be postulated that the latter regions possess two functional domains, one being distinct and responsible for the divergent neuronal specificity, whereas the other serves a common role in translocating the LC of either toxin.

However, prior disassembly of microtubules with colchicine, nocodazole, or griseofulvin reduced the potency of type B toxin, but not that of type A toxin; stabilization of the microtubules with taxol counteracted this effect of colchicine. Because colchicine treatment of synaptosomes did not interfere with the measurable binding of type B toxin or its apparent uptake, it appears to act intracellularly.

Relative to BoNT type A, the feeble neuromuscular paralytic activity of its two chains and the lack of activity observed with a proteolytic fragment, H2L (lacking H1, the C-terminal half of the heavy chain) highlight a requirement of the intact, disulphide-linked dichain protein for efficient targetting (binding/uptake) to peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. 3. In PC-12 cells, the renatured light chain alone proved equally potent as the whole toxin in reducing Ca2(+)-evoked noradrenaline release, when digitonin-permeabilization was used to overcome the uptake barrier. Treatment of BoNT A with 10 mM dithiothreitol, under non-denaturing conditions, was not very effective in reducing its inter-chain disulphide bond(s) and had little influence on the level of inhibition seen. 4. Altering the intra-synaptosomal concentrations of cyclic nucleotides (c-AMP, c-GMP) or protein kinase C activity failed to affect the reduction of Ca2(+)-dependent K(+)-stimulated noradrenaline release caused by BoNT A or B.

As a first approach, we have investigated the interaction of TeNT and BoNT with model membranes by photolabelling with phospholipid analogues carrying the photoreceptor group at different positions of the lipid molecule in order to probe different membrane regions. We found that at neutral pH TeNT and BoNTs (type A, B and E) adsorb onto the surface of negatively charged liposomes. Polysialogangliosides increase this interaction only slightly thus suggesting that they provide a minor contribution to toxin lipid binding. On this basis we propose that clostridial neurotoxins bind to lipids via both a predominant unspecific interaction with negatively charged lipids (including gangliosides) and a specific, but weaker, interaction with polysialogangliosides. At acidic pH values both chains of these neurotoxins are labelled strongly by photogroups located in the hydrophobic milieu of the membrane with a pH dependence that overlaps the range of pH values reached in the endosomal lumen.

No reduction in neurotransmitter release was observed following external application to these preparations of highly purified H2L or after intracellular injection into Aplysia neurons. 3.

Bath application of H2L and heavy chain together inhibited release of transmitter; however, at the neuromuscular junction the potency of this mixture was much lower than that of native toxin. A similar blockade resulted when heavy chain was applied intracellularly and H2L added to the bath, demonstrating that H2L is taken up into cholinergic neurons of Aplysia.

The pattern of the burst-like activity varied in shape and frequency in individual cells. Between the paroxysmal events, ongoing synaptic activity could be recorded. The other 40% of the treated neurons did not develop a characteristic pattern of bursts, but there was a decrease in frequency of synaptically generated events. In contrast to botulinum A neurotoxin, tetanus toxin invariably produced well organized paroxysmal events without any synaptic activity between them. At later stages botulinum A neurotoxin and tetanus toxin blocked inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic potentials in all neurons studied. These results have demonstrated, for the first time using electrophysiological techniques, that botulinum A neurotoxin blocks both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. There are however differences between these effects of botulinum A neurotoxin and the actions of tetanus toxin on these cells.

The data obtained allow the following conclusions to be made. 125I-BoNT type A, applied in vivo or in vitro to mouse diaphragm or frog cutaneous pectoris muscle, interacts saturably with the motor nerve terminal only; silver grains occur on the plasma membrane, within the synaptic bouton, and in the axoplasm of the nerve trunk, suggesting internalization and retrograde intra-axonal transport of toxin or fragments thereof. 125I-BoNT type B, applied in vitro to the murine neuromuscular junction, interacts likewise with the motor nerve terminal except that a lower proportion of internalized radioactivity is seen. This result is reconcilable with the similar, but not identical, pharmacological action of these toxin types. The saturability of labeling in each case suggested the involvement of acceptors; on preventing the internalization step with metabolic inhibitors, their precise location became apparent. They were found on all unmyelinated areas of the nerve terminal membrane, including the preterminal axon and the synaptic bouton. Although 125I-BoNT type A interacts specifically with developing terminals of newborn rats, the unmyelinated plasma membrane of the nerve trunk is not labeled, indicating that the acceptors are unique components restricted to the nerve terminal area. BoNT types A and B have distinct acceptors on the terminal membrane. Having optimized the conditions for saturation of these binding sites and calibrated the autoradiographic procedure, we found the densities of the acceptors for types A and B to be approximately 150 and 630/micron 2 of membrane, respectively.

Type A botulinum neurotoxin showed a limited capacity to inhibit the synaptosomal binding of labelled type B toxin, even at high concentrations (1 muM), and other neurotoxins were without effect, emphasising the acceptor selectivity. Near-complete loss of specific toxin binding was produced by preincubation of synaptosomes with neuraminidase whereas inhibition of the low-affinity sites with wheat-germ agglutinin was less pronounced; such inactivation was prevented by inclusion of selective inhibitors (2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively). These observations implicate N-acetylneuraminic acid and, possibly, other sugar moieties as constituents of the toxin acceptors. Trypsinisation of synaptosomes gave incomplete inhibition of binding when assayed with 1 nM or 10 nM 125I-iodinated toxin. Detailed analysis of the actions of neuraminidase, trypsin and heat treatment on the concentration dependence of toxin binding suggest the existence of at least two distinguishable populations of sites that contain N-acetylneuraminic acid, with a protein component being associated with the acceptors of lower affinity.

The form of the plaque differs in two independent cases of G1 arrest: the single plaque is found in a cell in stationary arrest of growth, whereas a cell arrested by mating factors in preparation for conjugation contains a satellite-bearing single plaque. The latter form is retained during zygote formation, where it serves as the initial site of fusion of each prezygotic nuceus with the other.

In the secretory pathway, heterotypic fusion takes place between small transport vesicles and organelles. It requires N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF/Sec18p), soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs/Sec17p) and SNAP receptors (SNAREs). SNAREs are integral membrane proteins (v-SNAREs on vesicles, t-SNAREs on the target organelles) and are thought to provide specificity to the fusion process. It has been suggested that Sec17p and Sec18p bind to v-SNARE/t-SNARE complexes and mediate the membrane fusion event. Homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles also requires Sec17p and Sec18p (ref. 6), but in vitro they are needed only to 'prime' the vacuoles, not for subsequent docking or fusion. It has been unclear whether these reactions involve SNAREs that are similar to those previously identified in heterotypic fusion systems and, hence, whether the actions of Sec18p/NSF and Sec17p/alpha SNAP in these systems can be compared. Here we identify typical v- and t-SNAREs on the yeast vacuolar membrane. Although both are normally present, vacuoles containing only the v-SNARE can fuse with those containing only the t-SNARE.

Biol. Chem. 267, 11681-11684] have been identified as synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP 2) and cellubrevin (VAMP 3) by using isoform-specific antisera. Additional antisera identify syntaxins 2 and 4 as the predominant target membrane SNAP receptors (t-SNAREs) in the plasma membranes (PM), with syntaxin 3 at one-twentieth the level. Syntaxins 2 and 4 are enriched 5-10-fold in PM compared with low-density microsomes (LDM). Insulin treatment results in an 11-fold increase in immunodetectable GLUT4 in PM and smaller (approx. 2-fold) increases in VAMP 2 and VAMP 3, whereas the subcellular distributions of the syntaxins are not altered by insulin treatment. To determine which of the SNAP receptors (SNAREs) in PM might participate in SNARE complexes with proteins from GLUT4 vesicles, complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody from solubilized membranes after the addition of myc-epitope-tagged N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and recombinant alpha-soluble NSF attachment protein (alpha-SNAP). These complexes contain VAMPs 2 and 3 and syntaxin 4, but not syntaxins 2 or 3. Complex formation requires ATP and is disrupted by ATP hydrolysis. When all membrane fractions are prepared from basal cells, few or no VAMPs and no syntaxin 4 are immunoprecipitated in SNARE complexes obtained from LDM alone (or from immunoisolated GLUT4 vesicles). The content of syntaxin 4 depends on the presence of PM, and participation of VAMPs 2 and 3 is enhanced 4-6-fold by the addition of solubilized GLUT4 vesicles to PM. The latter increase is greater than can be explained by the 2-fold higher levels of VAMPs added to the reaction mixture. When all membrane fractions are prepared from insulin-stimulated cells, SNARE complexes formed from PM alone contain similar levels of syntaxin 4 but 5-6-fold higher levels of VAMPs 2 and 3 compared with PM alone from basal cells. Addition of GLUT4 vesicle proteins to PM from insulin-treated cells results in a further 2-fold increase in VAMP 2 recovered in SNARE complexes. Therefore the VAMPs in PM of insulin-treated but not basal cells, and in GLUT4-vesicles from cells in either condition, are in a form that readily forms a SNARE complex with PM t-SNAREs and NSF.

In contrast to the early embryonic lethality observed in Sox2-null mice, Sox15-null ES cells and mice were grossly normal. DNA microarray analyses revealed that Otx2, Ctgf, Ebaf, and Hrc are dysregulated in Sox15-null ES cells, however.

In vivo, however, stem cells are generally thought to depend on specialised cellular microenvironments and to undergo predominantly asymmetric divisions. Ex vivo expansion of pure populations of tissue stem cells has proven elusive. Neural progenitor cells are propagated in combination with differentiating progeny in floating clusters called neurospheres. The proportion of stem cells in neurospheres is low, however, and they cannot be directly observed or interrogated. Here we demonstrate that the complex neurosphere environment is dispensable for stem cell maintenance, and that the combination of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) is sufficient for derivation and continuous expansion by symmetrical division of pure cultures of neural stem (NS) cells. NS cells were derived first from mouse ES cells. Neural lineage induction was followed by growth factor addition in basal culture media. In the presence of only EGF and FGF-2, resulting NS cells proliferate continuously, are diploid, and clonogenic. After prolonged expansion, they remain able to differentiate efficiently into neurons and astrocytes in vitro and upon transplantation into the adult brain. Colonies generated from single NS cells all produce neurons upon growth factor withdrawal. NS cells uniformly express morphological, cell biological, and molecular features of radial glia, developmental precursors of neurons and glia. Consistent with this profile, adherent NS cell lines can readily be established from foetal mouse brain. Similar NS cells can be generated from human ES cells and human foetal brain. The extrinsic factors EGF plus FGF-2 are sufficient to sustain pure symmetrical self-renewing divisions of NS cells. The resultant cultures constitute the first known example of tissue-specific stem cells that can be propagated without accompanying differentiation.

To address this hypothesis, we employed expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) as a model. We found that ES-MV (10 microg/ml) isolated from murine ES cells (ES-D3) in serum-free cultures significantly (i) enhanced survival and improved expansion of murine HPC, (ii) upregulated the expression of early pluripotent (Oct-4, Nanog and Rex-1) and early hematopoietic stem cells (Scl, HoxB4 and GATA 2) markers in these cells, and (iii) induced phosphorylation of MAPK p42/44 and serine-threonine kinase AKT. Furthermore, molecular analysis revealed that ES-MV express Wnt-3 protein and are selectively highly enriched in mRNA for several pluripotent transcription factors as compared to parental ES cells. More important, this mRNA could be delivered by ES-MV to target cells and translated into the corresponding proteins. The biological effects of ES-MV were inhibited after heat inactivation or pretreatment with RNAse, indicating a major involvement of protein and mRNA components of ES-MV in the observed phenomena.

We identified a specific modification pattern, termed \"bivalent domains,\" consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation.

Here we report that in fusions between ES cells and neural stem (NS) cells, increased levels of Nanog stimulate pluripotent gene activation from the somatic cell genome and enable an up to 200-fold increase in the recovery of hybrid colonies, all of which show ES cell characteristics. Nanog also improves hybrid yield when thymocytes or fibroblasts are fused to ES cells; however, fewer colonies are obtained than from ES x NS cell fusions, consistent with a hierarchical susceptibility to reprogramming among somatic cell types. Notably, for NS x ES cell fusions elevated Nanog enables primary hybrids to develop into ES cell colonies with identical frequency to homotypic ES x ES fusion products. This means that in hybrids, increased Nanog is sufficient for the NS cell epigenome to be reset completely to a state of pluripotency.

The four-gene transduction gave a higher probability of induction for archetypal pluripotent stem cell marker genes (Nanog, TDGF, and Dnmt3b) than for marker genes that are less specific for pluripotent stem cells (CYP26A1 and TERT) in primary induction culture. This tendency may reflect the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of human skin-derived cells into pluripotent stem cells. Among the colonies induced by the four-gene transduction, small cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio could be established by repeated cloning. Subsequently established cell lines were similar to human embryonic stem cells as well as human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from adult tissue in morphology, gene expression, long-term self-renewal ability, and teratoma formation.

These induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (hereafter called Fbx15 iPS cells) are similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation and teratoma formation; however, they are different with regards to gene expression and DNA methylation patterns, and fail to produce adult chimaeras.

The antigen was taken up vigorously, and to an approximately equal extent, by both primary and secondary follicles. The rate of uptake was faster in preimmunized than in virgin adult rats. The bulk of the antigen in follicles was extracellular, and persisted in this location for at least 3 wk. Label was most frequently found at or near the surface of fine cell processes. Many of these were branches of dendritic follicular reticular cells. Such processes interdigitated with equally fine processes of lymphocytes, creating an elaborate meshwork. In some cases, antigen was found between lymphocytes which appeared to be in close apposition. Occasionally, a few grains appeared over lymphocyte nuclei and study of serial sections suggested that this probably represented true entry of small amounts of antigen into lymphocytes. The characteristic \"tingible body\" macrophages (TBM) of germinal centers appeared to play only a secondary role in follicular antigen retention. They showed degrees of labeling over their phagocytic inclusions varying from negligible to moderately heavy. Moreover, follicles lacking or poor in TBM retained antigen just as effectively as those containing numerous TBM. The hypothesis is advanced that TBM may be derived from monocytes that migrate down from the circular sinus.

Mononuclear phagocytes were defined as mononuclear cells which are able to adhere to glass and phagocytize. In vitro labeling studies with thymidine-(3)H showed that monocytes in the peripheral blood and peritoneal macrophages do not multiply and can be considered end cells in a normal, steady state situation. However, the mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow appear to be rapidly dividing cells. This conclusion was supported by in vivo labeling experiments. A peak of labeled mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow was found 24 hr after a pulse of thymidine-(3)H. This was followed, 24 hr later, by a peak of labeled monocytes in the peripheral blood. From these experiments it was concluded that the rapidly dividing mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow, called promonocytes, are the progenitor cells of the monocytes. Labeling studies after splenectomy and after X-irradiation excluded other organs as a major source of the monocytes. Peak labeling of both the blood monocyte and peritoneal macrophages occurred at the same time. A rapid entry of monocytes from the blood into the peritoneal cavity was observed, after a sterile inflammation was evoked by an injection of newborn calf serum. These data have led to the conclusion that monocytes give rise to peritoneal macrophages. No indications have been obtained that mononuclear phagocytes originate from lymphocytes. In the normal steady state the monocytes leave the circulation by a random process, with a half-time of 22 hr. The average blood transit time of the monocytes has been calculated to be 32 hr.

The selective uptake of dextran sulfate by macrophages served as a useful cytoplasmic marker in identifying hybrids. Many characteristic macrophage properties were altered in the heterokaryons. Within an hour of fusion macrophage nuclei became swollen, nucleoli were more prominent, and increased nuclear RNA synthesis occurred. 3 hr after fusion, a wave of DNA synthesis took place in the previously dormant macrophage nuclei. The fate of typical macrophage markers was examined in both heterokaryons and homokaryons. Macrophage homokaryons continued to exhibit active phagocytosis of sensitized erythrocytes, whereas this capacity was lost irreversibly in heterokaryons. The loss of phagocytic activity of heterokaryons occurred at an exponential rate and was accelerated by high concentrations of calf serum. Another macrophage surface marker, a divalent cation-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), could be demonstrated histochemically on heterokaryons. Shortly after fusion, it was present in discrete regions, but it became more diffuse and disappeared within a day.

Assuming that nonlabeled lymphocytes migrated in the same manner as labeled lymphocytes, it can be concluded that the majority of lymphocytes present within mesenteric lymph nodes (74%) and Peyer's patches (61%), and a large proportion of those located in popliteal lymph nodes (40%) and the spleen (26%), were of thymic origin. Evidence is presented indicating that these are minimum values. The difference in the magnitude of thymic cell migration to gut-associated lymphoid tissue on the one hand and to the spleen and popliteal lymph node on the other hand was tentatively attributed to antigenic stimulation from the intestinal flora which develops during the first days of life. Thymus-derived lymphocytes were scattered throughout the lymph node cortex and splenic follicles. No noticeable thymic cell migration to the bone marrow was found. Labeling indices in the peripheral lymphoid organs paralleled those of cortical thymic lymphocytes suggesting the thymic cortex as the major source of migrants. By 2 days postinjection, the mean grain counts of labeled lymphocytes in all peripheral lymphoid tissues were higher than the mean grain counts of labeled lymphocytes in the thymus. At 7 days postinjection heavily labeled cells constituted 11-16% of the labeled population in peripheral tissues while they were absent from the thymic cortex. These results indicate that a fraction of thymus-derived cells, upon settling in the periphery, remained in, or reentered, a nonproliferative phase for at least 7 days. Conversely, many thymus-derived lymphocytes underwent division in the periphery and/or penetrated the intestinal epithelium. Since the relative number of thymus-derived cells found in the mesenteric lymph nodes of 1- and 2-day old mice was considerably higher than the percentage of cells at this site having the theta (theta) alloantigen, as reported by other authors, the possibility exists that theta-antigen on thymus-derived lymphocytes may, at least in a fraction of these cells, no longer be detectable as they reach the peripheral organs.", "pubdate_sims": "1972-04-01"}, "5025438": {"title": "Rejection of ascites tumor allografts.

This signal directs import of the rel-related protein dorsal into ventral and ventrolateral nuclei, thereby establishing dorsoventral polarity. We show by immunolocalization that tube protein associates with the plasma membrane during interphase. We also find that tube sequences required for signaling interact with pelle in a yeast two-hybrid assay. We demonstrate that fusion of the pelle catalytic domain to the transmembrane receptor torso is sufficient to induce ventral fates; this activity is independent of Toll or tube. Lastly, we find that fusion of the tube protein to torso also induces ventral fates, but only in the presence of functional pelle. We propose a model wherein tube activates pelle by recruiting it to the plasma membrane, thereby propagating the axis-determining signal.", "pubdate_sims": "1995-07"}, "8861100": {"title": "Characterization of an immunodeficiency mutant in Drosophila.", "abstract": "Drosophila immunity and embryogenesis appear to be linked by an evolutionarily ancient signalling pathway, which includes the Rel-domain transcription factors Dif and dorsal, respectively, as well as a common inhibitor, cactus. Previous genetic screens have centered on maternal mutants that disrupt the dorsal pathway. In an effort to identify additional components that influence Rel-domain gene function we have conducted a search for immunodeficiency mutants in Drosophila. One such mutant, which maps near the Black cells (Bc) gene, causes a severe impairment of the normal immune response, including attenuated induction of several immunity genes. Survival assays indicate a positive correlation between the induction of these genes, particularly diptericin, and resistance to bacterial infection. These studies are consistent with the notion that insect anti-microbial peptides work synergistically by binding distinct targets within infecting pathogens. Evidence is also presented that non-specific acquired immunity results from the persistence of bacterial metabolites long after primary infection.

Large differences in IFN-gamma production were observed between C57BL/10ScCr mice and the other mouse strains. With the exception of C57BL/10ScCr, all mouse strains, including C3H/HeJ, exhibited transient levels of IFN-gamma during infection with Salmonella typhimurium. Spleen cells of these mice, explanted on day 3 of infection, produced in vitro IFN-gamma spontaneously; this production was enhanced considerably by heat-killed S. typhimurium, heat-killed Propionibacterium acnes, concanavalin A (ConA), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These stimuli, except for LPS, also induced IFN-gamma production in cultures of normal spleen cells from noninfected animals. In contrast, C57BL/10ScCr mice produced no IFN-gamma following infection with S. typhimurium. Also, spleen cells of these mice, explanted on day 3 of infection, exhibited no spontaneous IFN-gamma production. A marginal response was obtained by additional stimulation of the cells with killed S. typhimurium, and a moderate response was obtained with ConA. Normal spleen cells from noninfected C57BL/10ScCr mice showed no IFN-gamma response to killed S. typhimurium, killed P. acnes, or LPS and only a low response to ConA. Impaired IFN-gamma production in C57BL/10ScCr mice was also evident during infection with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi, with which a low IFN-gamma response was seen only occasionally. Also, spleen cells from infected animals (days 2 to 8 after infection) exhibited only a very low level of IFN-gamma production in vitro; however, this production could be enhanced further by ConA. In comparison, C57BL/10ScSn mice infected with P. chabaudi chabaudi produced significant amounts of IFN-gamma. Spleen cells explanted from infected animals produced IFN-gamma spontaneously in vitro; this production was enhanced further by killed P. acnes and ConA. The results showed that in addition to the defect in LPS responsiveness, C57BL/10ScCr mice possess a defect in IFN-gamma production in response to different stimuli. During infection, IFN-gamma production and sensitization to LPS occurred in parallel. Infected Lpsn mice exhibited enhanced sensitivity and infected Lpsd C3H/HeJ mice exhibited reasonable sensitivity to the lethal effects of LPS.

Most of these were previously unpublished polymorphic microsatellites, identified by fragmentation of YAC and BAC clones spanning the region of interest. Lpsd was found to be inseparable from the microsatellite marker D4MIT178, and from three novel polymorphic microsatellites identified near D4MIT178.

Estimates based on pulsed field gel electrophoresis and fluorescence in situ hybridization indicate that the The B-->83.3 interval is about 3.2 Mb in length. A minimal area of zero recombinational distance from Lpsd was also assigned, and found to occupy approximately 1.2 Mb of physical size. To identify gene candidates, nearly 40,000 sequencing runs were performed across the critical region.

Experiments in which snap back was assessed for molecules broken by shearing indicate that there are probably two cross-links in each chromosome. Evidence that the cross-links occur at specific sites in the genome was obtained by treating total chromosomal DNA with the endonuclease EcoRI which cleaves the yeast genome into approximately 2,000 discrete fragments. Cross-link containing fragments were separated from fragments without cross-links. This purification resulted in enrichment for about 18 specific fragments. To determine whether the cross-links are terminal or at internal sites in chromosomal DNA, large shear-produced fragments were examined by electron microsopy. With complete denaturation few fragments exhibit the X-shaped single strand configuration expected for internal cross-links.

Both mature and immature extracellular virus particles were seen in thin-section electron micrographs of fixed, pelleted cellular material; on occasion, typical type C budding virus particles were seen. No form of intracellular virus particle has been seen. Mature particles were 100-110 nm in diameter, consisted of an electron-dense core surrounded by an outer membrane separated by an electron-lucent region, banded at a density of 1.16 g/ml on a continuous 25-65% sucrose gradient, and contained 70S RNA and a DNA polymerase activity typical of viral reverse transcriptase (RT; RNA-dependent DNA nucleotidyltransferase).

The absence of HTLV proviral sequences in DNA from normal humans showed that HTLV is not a ubiquitous endogenous (germ-line transmitted) virus of humans. Antibodies to HTLV core proteins have been identified in some people with T-cell neoplasias and are particularly prevalent in Japanese with adult T-cell leukemia, suggesting that HTLV is acquired horizontally. However, it was possible that HTLV is transmitted through the germ line of some (possibly rare) families and is then expressed in the HTLV- positive malignancies. An opportunity to study this question was provided by the development of several T-cell lines and a B-cell provided by the development of several T-cell lines and a B-cell line from one HTLV-positive patient with a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here we report that HTLV proteins or nucleic acids (or both) are found in three independently derived T-cell lines, all shown by HLA typing to have originated from the patient. In contrast, the B-cell line, the identity of which was also ascertained by HLA typing, contained no detectable HTLV protein, RNA, or proviral DNA.

The p24 core protein was purified to homogeneity. The amino acid composition, the COOH-terminal amino acid, and the NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 25 residues of this major internal structural protein were determined. These results were then compared to the known structure of the internal core protein of other retroviruses. The compositional data reveal that HTLV p24 is chemically distinct from p30-p24 of other animal retroviruses, in agreement with the earlier immunological analyses. However, HTLV p24 shares the common NH(2)-terminal proline and COOH-terminal leucine of all mammalian type C viral p30s. In addition, like bovine leukemia virus (BLV), HTLV lacks the common prolylleucylarginine tripeptide and the larger conserved region found near the NH(2) terminus of the other mammalian type C viral p30s. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of HTLV p24 with previously determined sequences of other retrovirus proteins, including BLV p24, reveals statistically significant sequence homology only to BLV. The results reported here demonstrate that HTLV p24 is related to but chemically distinct from the major core protein of other retroviruses. Similarly, previous results showed that there was no immunological crossreactivity of the p24 protein and reverse transcriptase of HTLV with other retroviruses, including BLV, and no nucleic acid sequence homology.

Both before and after ovulation, the level of activity in unfertilized eggs from In(X)/X females was twice that from XO females, and the distributions of activity in eggs for both sets of females remained unimodal. Beginning with the two-cell stage, distributions of activity for embryos from In(X)/X females were trimodal, which is evidence for embryonic activity. It is proposed that activation of a maternal mRNA or proenzyme is responsible for the HPRT activity increase in oocytes and early embryos and is supplemented by dosage-dependent activity of the embryonic Hprt gene as early as the two-cell stage.", "pubdate_sims": "1983-08"}, "6952245": {"title": "Cloned cDNA sequences of the hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene from a mouse neuroblastoma cell line found to have amplified genomic sequences.", "abstract": "Cloned cDNA sequences of the murine hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; EC 2.4.2.8) gene have been isolated by using a mouse neuroblastoma cell line containing increased levels of a variant HPRT protein.

A series of 17 independent mutants were isolated after viral infection together with 12 spontaneous noninfected mutants to characterize the nature of the mutations induced by the virus at the molecular level. The DNA of the mutants isolated after viral infection was probed with cloned HSV-2 fragments representing the entire genome. In these mutants, no authentic HSV-2 hybridization could be detected. This was indicative of a mechanism of mutagenesis which did not require the permanent integration of viral sequences in the host genome. The structure of the hprt gene was determined by the method of Southern (J. Mol. Biol. 98:503-517, 1975), and the level of hprt mRNA was analyzed by Northern blots. Except for the identification of one deletion mutant in each of the two groups, the HPRT- clones showed no evidence of alteration in their hprt gene. A total of 7 of 12 spontaneous mutants and 11 of 15 mutants isolated from the infected population transcribed an hprt mRNA of the same size and abundance as did the wild-type cells. Thus, the majority of the mutants seemed to have a point mutation in their hprt structural gene. Interestingly, the proportion of the different types of mutations was similar in the two groups of mutants. This analysis revealed that HSV-2 infection did not increase the frequency of rearrangements but rather that it probably induced a general increase of the level of mutations in the cells.

Mutation to the HPRT-negative phenotype occurred at frequencies of approximately 4 X 10(-5) to 3 X 10(-6) per generation. Most mutations in each of the five cell lines were associated with partial or complete deletions or rearrangements of the provirus. Several mutants retained a grossly intact HPRT provirus, and in one such mutant HPRT shutdown resulted from a revertible epigenetic mechanism that was not associated with global changes in proviral methylation.

The amplification of HPRT gene sequences in the unstable transferent GT427C was associated with the presence of multiple minute chromosome fragments.

The majority of the revertants examined had increases of between three- and tenfold in their specific activity of the enzyme, and they were able to grow continuously in the presence of HAT medium at 39 degrees C. When the revertants were cultivated in the absence of HAT, they recovered their HAT-sensitive phenotype and their lowered level of HPRT. Three of the revertants were examined for their temperature inactivation profiles, and all were found to have profiles identical to the ts parent, and quite different from the V79 wild type. The kinetic properties of the cell lines were studied: the Km for both PRPP and hypoxanthine was significantly different in the temperature-sensitive cells but was not significantly altered in the revertants with respect to the ts mutants. A specific antibody to Chinese hamster brain HPRT was employed in immunoprecipitation experiments. By measuring the point at which the immunoprecipitation of the antibody to HPRT was overcome by increasing concentrations of cell supernatant, it was possible to estimate the relative amount of enzyme molecules in the cell lines. From these data, it could be concluded that the revertants overproduced an enzyme with the same immunological properties as the ts line. Southern blots of the Hind III restricted DNA from the ts mutant and two revertant cell lines were examined with an HPRT cDNA probe. This established that the HPRT gene was amplified twofold in one of the revertants, and threefold in the other. However, if the revertants were reintroduced into nonselective medium, the gene copy number declined to one. Finally, northern blots of RNA extracted from the various cell lines demonstrated that the HPRT mRNA was augmented 1.5-fold in one revertant and 1.4-fold in the other. Reintroduction into non-selective medium resulted in a decline in mRNA level for the second mutant, whereas the first mutant appeared to be stabilized.

In this study, we have expressed the genes in an insect cell line to explore their role in the apoptotic pathway.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCo-expression of ced-4 with ced-3 in insect cells stimulated both the induction and the level of CED-3-mediated apoptosis. Stimulation of CED-3-dependent apoptosis by CED-4 was accompanied by accelerated processing of CED-3, which was dependent on the presence of a wild-type CED-3 prodomain and a conserved lysine residue within a putative ATP/GTP-binding motif of CED-4. Co-expression of ced-9 with ced-4 and ced-3 inhibited the ability of CED-4 to stimulate CED-3 processing and CED-3-dependent apoptosis. Although a temperature-sensitive CED-9 mutant was unable to block CED-4 activity and failed to associate with CED-4, a deletion mutant of CED-9 lacking the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain could associate with CED-4 and block CED-4 activity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results establish a role for CED-4 in the processing of CED-3 and the stimulation of CED-3-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that CED-9 achieves its anti-apoptotic effect by associating with CED-4 and blocking the ability of CED-4 to process CED-3.", "pubdate_sims": "1997-07-01"}, "8706125": {"title": "An alternatively spliced C. elegans ced-4 RNA encodes a novel cell death inhibitor.", "abstract": "The C. elegans gene ced-4 is essential for programmed cell death.

A number of genes and molecules promoting or protective against cell death is at present-day known and an important information about the external and internal signals involved in stimulation and suppression of apoptosis is also emerging. In the intracellular pathway of the death deregulation of [Ca2+](i) plays a pivotal role. Increased ionized intracellular calcium stimulates both the activation of enzymes (protein kinases, endonucleases, proteases and phospholipases) and plasma membrane K+ channels. This calcium-mediated activation leads to morphostructural changes, such as cell shrinkage, cytoplasmatic blebbing, nuclear chromatin condensation and DNA degradation into oligonucleosomal fragments. At least some genes of the cell death pathway have been conserved throughout animal evolution; ced-3 e ced-9 that regulate the initiation of cellular suicide in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are homologous to genes that in mammalian cells are thought to play a similar role (interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme [ICE] family, Bcl-2).

Firstly, its general importance has been widely recognised only in the past few years and its surprising significance is still being evaluated in a number of areas of biology. Secondly, although apoptosis is now accepted as a critical element in the repertoire of potential cellular responses, the picture of the intra-cellular processes involved is probably still incomplete, not just in its details, but also in the basic outline of the process as a whole. It is therefore a very interesting and active area at present and is likely to progress rapidly in the next two or three years. This review emphasises recent work on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and, in particular, on the intracellular interactions which control this process. This latter area is of crucial importance since dysfunction of the normal control machinery is likely to have serious pathological consequences, probably including oncogenesis, autoimmunity and degenerative disease. The genetic analysis of programmed cell death during the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proved very useful in identifying important events in the cell death programme. Recently defined genetic connections between C. elegans cell death and mammalian apoptosis have emphasised the value of this system as a model for cell death in mammalian cells, which, inevitably, is more complex. The signals inducing apoptosis are very varied and the same signals can induce differentiation and proliferation in other situations. However, some pathways appear to be of particular significance in the control of cell death; recent analysis of the apoptosis induced through the cell-surface Fas receptor has been especially important for immunology. Two gene families are dealt with in particular detail because of their likely importance in apoptosis control. These are, first, the genes encoding the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme family of cysteine proteases and, second, those related to the proto-oncogene bcl-2. Both of these families are homologous to cell death genes in C. elegans. In mammalian cells the number of members of both families which have been identified is growing rapidly and considerable effort is being directed towards establishing the roles played by each member and the ways in which they interact to regulate apoptosis. Other genes with established roles in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation are also important in controlling apoptosis. Several of these are known proto-oncogenes, e.g. c-myc, or tumour suppressors, e.g. p53, an observation which is consistent with the importance of defective apoptosis in the development of cancer. Viral manipulation of the apoptosis of host cells frequently involves interactions with these cellular proteins. Finally, the biochemistry of the closely controlled cellular self-destruction which ensues when the apoptosis programme has been engaged is also very important. The biochemical changes involved in inducing phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell, for example, allow the process to be neatly integrated within the tissues, under physiological conditions.

Recent data suggest that in animals, a genetically regulated, signal transduction-dependent programmed cell death process, commonly referred to as apoptosis, is conserved over a wide range of phyla. The basic function of apoptosis is to direct the selective elimination of certain cells during development, but it also is a master template that is involved in host responses to many pathogens. Programmed cell death in plants, while widely observed, has not been studied extensively at either the biochemical or genetic level. Current data suggest that activation or suppression of programmed cell death may underlie diseases in plants as it does in animals.

Its rediscovery in the second half of this century, and the coining of the term apoptosis in 1972 by Kerr, Wyllie, and Currie, ignited an unparalleled interest in this field of science. The number of publications related to apoptosis has been growing exponentially every year ever since. This is mainly due to three major advances, two of which have been made recently and one that is currently seen. First, studies with the small nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a number of apoptosis regulating genes--the first evidence that cell death is an active process under genetic control. Many of these genes have mammalian homologs that, like their worm counterparts, seem to regulate mammalian apoptosis. Second, elucidation of the signal transduction pathways of apoptosis has lead especially to the identification of specific death signaling molecules such as a new family of cysteine proteases, the caspases. Third, it has now become clear that many diseases are characterized by dysregulation of apoptotic programs. Many of these programs involve a family of receptors and their ligands, the death receptor/ligand family.

The cortical and cytoplasmic events of PC can be mimicked in other cells during cytokinesis by displacing the mitotic apparatus with the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole. In all cases, the polarity of the resulting cortical and cytoplasmic flows correlates with the position of the attenuated mitotic spindle formed. These cortical flows are also accompanied by a change in the distribution of the cortical actin network. The polarity of this redistribution is similarly correlated with the location of the attenuated spindle.

Treatment of the supernatant fraction with Triton X-100 increased activity to approximately the same extent as preincubation, but would not increase the activity after preincubation. By chromatography on Sepharose 2B, before and after preincubation, it was demonstrated that the increase in activity was only associated with the soluble guanylate cyclase, and not the particulate enzyme. Activation by preincubation required O2. It was completely inhibited by thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and by bovine serum albumin, KCN, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. These inhibitors suggested a copper requirement for activation, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that 20 to 60 muM CuCl2 could relieve the inhibition by 0.1 mM sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. 2-Mercaptoethanol inhibition could also be reversed by removal of the thiol on a Sephadex G-25 column, however, this treatment partially activated the enzyme. Addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a preincubated preparation would not reverse the activation. H2O2 was found to activate guanylate cyclase, either by its generation in the lung supernatant with glucose oxidase and glucose, or by its addition to a preparation in which the catalase was inhibited with KCN. KCN or bovine serum albumin was able to partially inhibit activation by glucose oxidase plus glucose, however, larger amounts of glucose oxidase could overcome that inhibition, indicating a catalytic role for Cu2+ at low H2O2 concentrations. No direct evidence for H2O2 formation during preincubation could be found, however, indirect evidence was obtained by the spectrophotometric detection of choleglobin formation from hemoglobin present in the lung supernatant fluid.

Wtih NaN3 activation guanylate cyclase activities wite similar with Mn2+ and Mg2+.

With soluble liver enzyme both manganese and magnesium activities were dependent upon excess Mn2+ or Mg2+ at a fixed MnGTP or MgGTP concentration of 0.4 mm; apparent Km values for excess Mn2+ and Mg2+ were 0.3 and 0.24 mM, respectively. After NaN3 activation, the activity was less dependent upon free Mn2+ and retained its dependence for free Mg2+, at 0.4 mM MgGTP the apparent Km for excess Mg2+ was 0.3 mM. The activity of soluble liver guanylate cyclase assayed with Mn2+ or Mg2+ was increased with Ca2+. After NaN3 activiation, Ca2+ had no effect or was somewhat inhibitory with either Mn2+. After NaN activation, Ca2+ had no effect or was somewhat inhibitory with either Mn2+ or Mg2+.

Activation was most remarkable in crude mitochondrial fraction. When the crude mitochondrial fraction was subjected to osmotic shock and fractionated, guanylate cyclase activity recovered in the subfractions as assayed with hydroxylamine was only one-third of the starting material. Recombination of the soluble and the particulate fractions, however, restored guanylate cyclase activity to the same level as that of the starting material. When varying quantities of the particulate and soluble fractions were combined, enzyme activity was proportional to the quantity of the soluble fraction. Heating of the soluble or particulate fraction at 55 degrees for 5 min inactivated guanylate cyclase. The heated particulate fraction markedly activated guanylate cyclase activity in the native soluble fraction, while the heated soluble fraction did not stimulate enzyme activity in the particulate. The particulate fraction preincubated with hydroxylamine at 37 degrees for 5 min followed by washing activated guanylate cyclase activity in the soluble fraction in the absence of hydroxylamine. Further fractionation of the crude mitochondrial fraction revealed that the factor(s) needed for the activation by hydroxylamine is associated with the mitochondria. The mitochondrial fraction of cerebral cortex activated guanylate cyclase in supernatant of brain, liver, or kidney in the presence of hydroxylamine. The mitochondrial fraction prepared from liver or kidney, in turn, activated soluble guanylate cyclase in brain. Activation of guanylate cyclase by hydroxylamine was compared with that of sodium azide. Azide activated guanylate cyclase in the synaptosomal soluble fraction, while hydroxylamine inhibited it. The particulate fraction preincubated with azide followed by washing did not stimulate guanylate cyclase activity in the absence of azide. The activation of guanylate cyclase by hydroxylamine is not due to a change in the concentration of the substrate GTP, Addition of hydroxylamine did not alter the apparent Km value of guanylate cyclase for GTP. Guanylate cyclase became less dependent on manganese in the presence of hydroxylamine.

Neither the protein activator factor nor catalase which is required for sodium azide effects altered the stimulatory effect of sodium nitroprusside. In the presence of sodium azide, sodium nitroprusside or hydroxylamine, magnesium ion was as effective as manganese ion as a sole cation cofactor for guanylate cyclase.

Agonist that cause contraction (bradykinin, histamine, and serotonin) cause accumulation of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP) without altering adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP). They appear to act through two different mechanisms: one Ca++-dependent, the other Ca++-inhibited. O2 increased the cGMP content of the artery in a Ca++-dependent manner without affecting the cAMP content. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (oligomycin and 2,4-dinitrophenol) did not diminish this effect of O2. O2 was required for demonstration of the Ca++-dependent accumulation of cGMP in response to bradykinin, histamine, and ionophore A23187. The effect of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine on basal cGMP content and on the bradykinin-induced accumulation was also dependent on the presence of O2. Methylene blue and sodium ascorbate caused cGMP accumulation in O2-deprived arteries. Their effects were not diminished in Ca++-depleted arteries and, in fact, seemed to be inhibited when 2.7 mM Ca++ was present in the medium. The effects of these agents and of serotonin on cGMP, which were inhibited by Ca++, were also inhibited by O2. These non Ca++-, non O2-dependent agents (methylene blue, ascorbate, and serotonin) did not, however, permit demonstration of the effects of the Ca++- and O2-dependent agonists on O2-deprived arteries.

Little or no effect of NaN3 was observed with preparations from lung, heart, and several other tissues.

Increases in cGMP were maximal in response to these concentrations of the agonists and occurred within 2 min. Exclusion of Ca2+ from the incubation media reduced basal cGMP by 50% in 20 min and abolished responses to carbamylcholine and NaF, while exclusion of Mg2+ was without effect. Analogous reductions in cGMP were observed in complete buffer containing 1 mM tetracaine, an agent which blocks movement of Ca2+ across and binding to biologic membranes. By contrast, exclusion of Ca2+ or addition of tetracaine did not alter relative cGMP responses to NaN3 (6-fold increase over basal), although levels were reduced in slices exposed to these buffers for 20 min. When slices were incubated without Ca2+ or with tetracaine for only 2 min prior to addition of agonists, basal cGMP did not decline. Under these conditions, both absolute and relative increases in cGMP in response to NaN3 were comparable to those of slices incubated throughout in complete buffer, while carbamylcholine and NaF effects on cGMP were abolished. NaN3 increased guanylate cyclase activity of whole homogenates (10- to 20-fold), and of the 100,000 X g soluble (20-fold) and particulate (4-fold) fractions of cortex. Prior incubation of slices with NaN3 in the presence or absence of Ca2+ or with Ca2+ plus tetracaine also markedly enhanced enzyme activity in homogenates and subcellular fractions subsequently prepared from these slices. In the presence of 3 mM excess MnCl2, NaN3 raised the apparent Km for MnGTP of soluble guanylate cyclase from 0.11 mM to 0.20 mM, and reduced enzyme dependence on Mn2+. Thus, when Mg2+ was employed as the sole divalent cation in the enzyme reaction mixture basal and NaN3-responsive activities were 7% and 30% of those seen with optimal concentrations of Mn2+, respectively. Under a variety of assay conditions where responses to NaN3 were readily detectable, alterations in guanylate cyclase activities could not be demonstrated in response to carbamylcholine or NaF. By contrast Ca2+ increased the guanylate cyclase activity 6- to 7-fold over basal under conditions of reduced Mn2+ (0.75 mM Mn2+/1 mM GTP). This latter effect of Ca2+ was shared by Mg2+ and not blocked by tetracaine. Carbamylcholine, NaF, Ca2+, and NaN3 all failed to alter cGMP phosphodiesterase activity in cortex.

Thus, the particulate enzyme could play a key role in regulating cGMP levels inthe intact cell where Mn2+ concentrations are low. The soluble and particulate enzymes from inner medulla were further distinguished by their responses to several test agents. The soluble enzyme was activated by Ca2+, NaN3, NaNo2 and phenylhydrazine, whereas particulate activity was inhibited by Ca2+ and was unresponsive to the latter agents. In the presence of NaNo2, Mn2+ requirement of the soluble enzyme was reduced and equivalent to that of the particulate preparation.

These changes in metal requirements may be involved in the action of NaNO2 to increase cGMP in intact kidney.

By chromatography on Sepharose 2B, before and after preincubation, it was demonstrated that the increase in activity was only associated with the soluble guanylate cyclase, and not the particulate enzyme. Activation by preincubation required O2. It was completely inhibited by thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and by bovine serum albumin, KCN, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. These inhibitors suggested a copper requirement for activation, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that 20 to 60 muM CuCl2 could relieve the inhibition by 0.1 mM sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. 2-Mercaptoethanol inhibition could also be reversed by removal of the thiol on a Sephadex G-25 column, however, this treatment partially activated the enzyme.

These findings show that detergent activates the enzyme by changing its conformation and not simply by dispersing nonsedimentable membrane fragments. The dimensions of this guanylate cyclase in detergent are very similar to those of detergent-solubilized adenylate cyclase from the same tissue (Neer, E.J. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6527-6531). Guanylate cyclase can be solubilized from the particulate cell fraction with 1% Lubrol PX but has properties quite different from those of the guanylate cyclase in the soluble cell fraction. It is a large aggregate with a value of S20,w of about 10 S, Stokes radius of 65 A, and a mass of approximately 300,000 daltons. However, the peaks of guanylate cyclase activity in column effluents and sucrose density gradients are very broad indicating a mixture of different size proteins. The conditions used to solubilize guanylate cyclase from the particulate fraction also solubilize adenylate cyclase, and the two activities can be separated on the same sucrose gradient.

The activation of guanylate cyclase was dependent upon NaN3 concentration and temperature; preincubation prevented the time lag of activation observed during incubation. The concentration of NaN3 that resulted in half-maximal activation was 0.04 mM. Sodium azide increased the apparent Km for GTP from 35 to 113 muM. With NaN3 activation the enzyme was less dependent upon the concentration of free Mn2+. Activation of enzyme by NaN3 was irreversible with dilution or dialysis of reaction mixtures. The slopes of Arrhenius plots were altered with sodium azide-activated enzyme, while gel filtration of the enzyme on Sepharose 4B was unaltered by NaN3 treatment. Triton X-100 increased the activity of the enzyme, and in the presence of Triton X-100 the activation by NaN3 was not observed.

Guanylate cyclase activity is found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction of normal rat kidney (NRK) and BALB 3T3 cells. Enzyme activity is stimulated 3- to 10-fold by treatment with the detergent Lubrol PX. However, enhancement of guanylate cyclase by fibroblast growth factor could not be demonstrated under a variety of assay conditions. In both NRK and BALB 3T3 cells guanylate cyclase activity is low during logarithmic growth and increases as the cells crowd together and growth slows. Guanylate cyclase activity is undetectable in homogenates of NRK cells transformed by the Kirsten sarcoma virus (KNRK cells) either in the presence or absence of Lubrol PX.

Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is found predominately in the soluble fraction of NRK cells. This activity increases slightly as NRK cells enter the stationary growth phase. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is undetectable in two clones of KNRK cells under a variety of assay conditions, and is decreased relative to the level present in NRK cells in a third KNRK clone. However, both Moloney- and Schmidt-Ruppin-transformed NRK cells have a phosphodiesterase activity similar to that found in NRK cells. Boiled supernatant from both NRK and KNRK cells is observed to appreciably enhance the activity of activator-deficient phosphodiesterase from bovine heart. This result indicates that the absence of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity in KNRK cells is not due to a loss of the phosphodiesterase activator. The intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP is found to be very low in transformed NRK cells when compared to levels measured in confluent NRK cells. The low levels of cyclic GMP in transformed NRK cells reflect the greatly decreased guanylate cyclase activity observed in these cells.

Analogous reductions in cGMP were observed in complete buffer containing 1 mM tetracaine, an agent which blocks movement of Ca2+ across and binding to biologic membranes. By contrast, exclusion of Ca2+ or addition of tetracaine did not alter relative cGMP responses to NaN3 (6-fold increase over basal), although levels were reduced in slices exposed to these buffers for 20 min. When slices were incubated without Ca2+ or with tetracaine for only 2 min prior to addition of agonists, basal cGMP did not decline. Under these conditions, both absolute and relative increases in cGMP in response to NaN3 were comparable to those of slices incubated throughout in complete buffer, while carbamylcholine and NaF effects on cGMP were abolished.

specific blocking agent of edrf, abolished this depression. it is unlikely that the endothelium-dependent depression was due to stimulation of release of edrf, because clonidine did not produce endothelium-dependent relaxation in precontracted rings even when its contractile action was blocked by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. further evidence against alpha adrenoceptor agents

concentration-contraction curves for phenylephrine for both endothelium-containing rings and for endothelium-denuded rings now became very similar to the corresponding curves obtained for clonidine

From dose-response curves for adrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) obtained in strips of rat aorta before and after incubation with each of the three blocking agents, the fractions of receptors remaining active for adrenaline and 5-HT, respectively, were estimated. After blockade with DA-VIII-MBr the receptors for adrenaline were blocked considerably, but those for 5-HT were little affected. Dibenamine blocked the receptors to adrenaline and 5-HT almost equally. The effective dose of phenoxybenzamine for adrenaline receptors was less than one hundredth that of dibenamine or DA-VIII-MBr, but specificity for these receptors was intermediate between those of dibenamine and DA-VIII-MBr.

The present experiment investigated the effects on hypothalamic self-stimulation of the alpha agonist clonidine in normal and in catecholamine-depleted rats. Using a shuttle-box technique that provides a rate-independent index of the rewarding and aversive components of ICS, it was demonstrated that clonidine produces a dose-dependent inhibition of reward that is clearly dissociable from any non-specific effects of the drug. The ineffectiveness of the peripheral alpha-agonist 1-phenylephrine indicates that the inhibition of reward produced by clonidine is mediated centrally. Clonidine and the catecholamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine act together in a synergistic manner to greatly increase the magnitude and prolong the duration of the inhibition of reward while leaving the aversive component unaffected. These data are interpreted as supporting an alpha-noradrenergic basis of ICS reward while indicating that the aversive component of ICS is essentially independent of noradrenergic transmission.", "pubdate_sims": "1976-05"}, "16578626": {"title": "Hereditary rings.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1966-01"}, "16590244": {"title": "THE STRUCTURE OF PRIME RINGS WITH MAXIMUM CONDITIONS.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1958-06"}, "17815937": {"title": "Megalithic rings.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1970-09-18"}, "17830570": {"title": "Rings, rings, what makes the rings?", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1982-06-11"}, "17831458": {"title": "Rings within rings within rings within . .", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1980-12-05"}, "17835091": {"title": "AN EXPLANATION OF LIESEGANG'S RINGS.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1921-11-11"}, "17843679": {"title": "AN EXPLANATION OF LIESEGANG'S RINGS.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1921-07-22"}, "18127780": {"title": "The influence of dibenamine upon circulatory reactions to ephedrine and neosynephrine in normal man.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1949-05"}, "2121": {"title": "The influence of temperature increase, elevation of extracellular h+-concentration, and of triiodothyronine on the actions of phenylephrine, histamine, and beta-sympathomimetic drugs on rabbit aortic strips.", "abstract": "In the isolated preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta, the affinities of the vasoconstrictor agents phenylephrine and histamine, as well as of the vasodilator beta-sympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline, fenoterol (TH 1165a), terbutaline, and salbutamol under the conditions of temperature increase, triiodothyronine and decrease of extracellular pH were investigated.

Noradrenaline (NA) and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine induced concentration-dependent contractions in PC and PA preparations. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was without effect on PC but contracted PA preparations; it was less potent and had less intrinsic activity than phenylephrine. In PC and PA strips, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin was more effective than the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine to inhibit NA-induced contractions. Prazosin, but not rauwolscine, inhibited electrically induced contractions in PC strips. The muscarinic receptor agonists acetylcholine and carbachol were without effect in PC and PA preparations. In both PC and PA preparations, clonidine decreased and rauwolscine increased the electrically elicited 3H-efflux after pre-loading of the tissues with 3H-noradrenaline. Carbachol and scopolamine were without consistent effects. In radioligand receptor binding experiments, the occurrence of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding sites was demonstrated; the ratio between alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding sites was 3/2 in PC, but 2/3 in PA tissue. By autoradiography, muscarinic receptors were found to be localized exclusively to the glandular epithelium, consistent with the lack of contractile effects of muscarinic receptor active drugs on PC and PA preparations. Our results thus suggest that the main alpha-adrenoceptor function in human prostatic smooth muscle is of the alpha 1-type and that muscarinic receptors in the prostate are involved in processes other than control of smooth muscle contraction.", "pubdate_sims": "1985-12"}, "2421829": {"title": "Pharmacological characterization of the receptor mediating the adrenergic inhibition of responses to substance P in the cingulate cortex.", "abstract": "The excitatory responses of neurones in the anterior cingulate cortex of the rat to iontophoretically applied substance P (SP) are reduced by noradrenaline (NA) applied iontophoretically or released from noradrenergic pathways. In order to determine the receptor involved in this inhibitory effect we have studied the effects of a number of receptor-specific adrenergic agonists and antagonists on responses of cingulate neurones to SP in rats anaesthetized with chloral hydrate. Low iontophoretic currents (0-15 nA) of NA, adrenaline and the beta-agonist, clenbuterol, all strongly reduced responses to SP. Isoprenaline was also effective but less consistently so, although problems were experienced with its iontophoretic release from micropipettes. The alpha 1-agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine were also able to reduce responses to SP. However, this reduction required higher iontophoretic currents (15-60 nA) and was associated with depressant effects on baseline firing rate. The alpha 2-agonist clonidine was only weakly active at high currents and this too was associated with depression of baseline firing. Similar weak effects were noted with dopamine. The inhibitory effects of NA on SP responses were convincingly blocked or reversed by the beta-antagonist, practolol, but not by the alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin. The reduction of SP responses by phenylephrine was also blocked by practolol but unaffected by prazosin. Finally, reduction of SP excitations by activation of the coeruleocortical pathway was also blocked by practolol applied iontophoretically to the cortical cells.

The components of the response which were revealed were further analysed by using drugs which modify Ca2+ mobilization.

In this study we have investigated the possibility that the endothelium may also modulate alpha adrenergic agonist-induced vasoconstriction. The responses of rat aortae to selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists were studied. Removal of the endothelium did not significantly alter the maximum contractile response to norepinephrine. However, the maximum responses to selective alpha-1 agonists (phenylephrine and methoxamine) were increased 2-fold. The vasoconstrictor effects of both clonidine and B-HT920 (selective alpha-2 agonists) were enhanced 5- to 7-fold after removal of the endothelial cell layer. The sensitivity of the tissue, as reflected by the EC50 value, to each alpha adrenergic agonist was enhanced in the absence of endothelium. An explanation for the present results is that alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists activate adrenoceptors in the endothelial cells and thereby may promote the release of a relaxing factor to inhibit vascular smooth muscle contraction. Removal of the endothelium would abolish release of this putative inhibitory substance and adrenergic agonist would activate only adrenoceptors in the muscle to cause vasoconstriction. On the other hand, endothelial cells may function as an uptake site for the various adrenergic agonists. Ablation of this uptake process could conceivably result in a greater effective concentration of the agonist in the receptor area and thus promote a stronger vasoconstrictor effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "pubdate_sims": "1985-03"}, "2861277": {"title": "Blockade of endothelium-dependent and glyceryl trinitrate-induced relaxation of rabbit aorta by certain ferrous hemoproteins.", "abstract": "We have reported previously that hemoglobin inhibits endothelium-dependent and glyceryl trinitrate-induced relaxation in the rabbit aorta.

Although this \"anatomical\" subclassification is generally applicable, many exceptions exist. A more useful classification of alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes is based on a pharmacological characterization in which selective agonists and antagonists are used. Peripheral alpha-adrenoceptors are critical in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. Postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors in arteries and veins represent a mixed population of alpha 1/alpha 2-adrenoceptors, with both subtypes mediating vasoconstriction.

It has been proposed that junctional alpha-adrenoceptors will respond predominantly to norepinephrine liberated from sympathetic neurons, whereas extrajunctional alpha-adrenoceptors likely respond to circulating catecholamines.

The functional importance of endothelium-dependent dilatation is emphasized by the fact that the direct vasoconstrictor effects of some of these substances (acetylcholine, histamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) on vascular smooth muscle is attenuated or even reversed by their simultaneous stimulatory effect on endothelial cells resulting in the release of a vasodilator signal. Bioassay experiments have shown that a humoral vasodilator agent with a biological half-life in the range of seconds is released from the endothelium (native or cultured) during stimulation with acetylcholine, ATP and calcium ionophore. Experimental data are presented which suggest that EDRF may act by direct stimulation of guanylate cyclase, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation due to increased smooth muscle cyclic GMP levels. The chemical nature of this nonprostaglandin endothelium-derived relaxant factor (EDRF) is still not known. The possible physiological and pathophysiological significance of endothelium-dependent dilatation in situ is discussed. Special attention is paid in this context to the potential role of EDRF activity in coronary vasomotor control.", "pubdate_sims": "1985"}, "3004655": {"title": "Noradrenergic stimulation of supraoptic neuronal activity and vasopressin release in vitro: mediation by an alpha 1-receptor.", "abstract": "Using the isolated rat hypothalamoneurohypophysial system, the effects of noradrenaline (NA) and some adrenoceptor agonists on vasopressin (VP) release and supraoptic neuronal activity were assessed in vitro.

When administered to rats, the effect of clonidine on type II inhibitor activity in the hypothalamus and brain-stem depended on the dose. Low doses (10-50 micrograms X kg-1 i.p.) produced an increase, probably by stimulating presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors, whereas large doses (200-1000 micrograms X kg-1 i.p.) produced a decrease of type II inhibitor activity by stimulating postsynaptic receptors. The development of vasopressin hypertension was associated with a gradual reduction of the response of the type II inhibitor to low and high doses of clonidine. In vasopressin-hypertensive rats neither small nor large doses of clonidine were able to induce changes in type II inhibitor activity suggesting subsensitivity of pre- and postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. However, clonidine appeared to be equally effective in blocking electrically stimulated [3H]noradrenaline release from hypothalamic slices of vasopressin-hypertensive and control, normotensive rats.

For any single concentration of phenylephrine in the presence of endothelium, the initial phasic components of contractions were significantly greater, the maximal contractions were achieved sooner and were less well maintained as compared to contractions elicited in the absence of endothelium. The kinetic characteristics of contractions stimulated by single concentrations of PGF2 alpha were similar in the presence and absence of endothelium and did not exhibit initial phasic components of contraction.

As it is very unlikely that neurotransmitter released from the periarterial nerves, which are confined to the adventitial-medial border, diffuses all the way through the medial muscle coat before acting on endothelial cells to release EDRF to produce vasodilatation, this discovery has been regarded as an indication of a pathophysiological mechanism, rather than a physiological one (see refs 2, 3). ACh is rapidly degraded in the blood by acetylcholinesterase, so that ACh must be released locally to be effective on endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate the immunocytochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase in endothelial cells of small brain vessels, which is consistent with the view that the ACh originates from endothelial cells that can synthesize and store it. We suggest that release of ACh following damage to endothelial cells during ischaemia contributes to a pathophysiological mechanism of vasodilation which protects that segment of vessel from further damage as well as brain cells from hypoxia.", "pubdate_sims": "1985"}, "450965": {"title": "Effect of clonidine on the contractile responsiveness of aortic smooth muscle to norepinephrine.", "abstract": "A length-tension relationship was established for aortic smooth muscle of rats by means of membrane depolarization with KCl.

Perfusion of the aortic arch with norepinephrine produced an excitatory response which consisted of: a drug-evoked stimulation of previously quiescent fibers at 0 mm Hg, and a sensitization of the response to pressure.

When NaCl was replaced with Na isethionate or glucuronate, noradrenaline evoked small depolarizations in most of the cells but the sensitivity to noradrenaline (mV/nC) was reduced by over 80%. In other cells either no potential change or hyperpolarization was observed. In solutions containing low Cl the resting membrane potential was slightly depolarized by a mean value of 5-10 mV (depending on the anion substitute) and the membrane resistance was unaltered. In normal Krebs solution noradrenaline and phenylephrine evoked biphasic contractile responses but when NaCl was replaced by Na benzenesulphonate the initial rapid contraction was diminished greatly or abolished. However, the maximum tension produced by any concentration of noradrenaline was unaltered in low Cl solution although the contractions produced by phenylephrine were depressed in low Cl media.

Catalase or methemoglobin enabled phenylhydrazine to activate guanylate cyclase 10-fold and enhanced activation by NO to over 100-fold. Heme-containing enzyme was activated only 3-fold by phenylhydrazine but over 100-fold by NO. Added hemoproteins enhanced enzyme activation by phenylhydrazine to 12-fold without enhancing activation by NO. Reducing or anaerobic conditions inhibited, whereas oxidants enhanced enzyme activation by phenylhydrazine plus catalase, and KCN had no effect. In contrast, enzyme activation by NO and NaN3 was inhibited by oxidants or KCN. NaN3 required native catalase, whereas phenylhydrazine also utilized heat-denatured catalase for enzyme activation. Thus, the mechanism of guanylate cyclase activation by phenylhydrazine differed from that by NO or NaN3. Guanylate cyclase activation by phenylhydrazine resulted from an O2-dependent reaction between phenylhydrazine and hemoproteins to generate stable iron-phenyl hemoprotein complexes. These complexes activated guanylate cyclase in the absence of O2, but lost activity after acidification, basification, or heating. Gel filtration of prereacted mixtures of [U-14C]phenylhydrazine plus hemoproteins resulted in co-chromatography of radioactivity, protein, and guanylate cyclase stimulating activity, and yielded a phenyl-hemoprotein binding stoichiometry of four under specified conditions (one phenyl/heme).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals on myocardial structure and function in an isolated perfused rabbit interventricular septal preparation. Superoxide was generated by adding purine (2.3 mM) and xanthine oxidase (0.01 U/ml) to the physiological solutions perfusing the septa. Hydroxyl radical generation was catalyzed by the addition of 2.4 microM Fe3+-loaded transferrin to the system. Exposure of normal septa to superoxide-generating solutions resulted in the development of structural alterations in the vascular endothelium including the development of vacuoles. Membranous cellular debris was evident in the extracellular space and within the vessels. Cardiac myocytes showed evidence of mild alterations. Exposure of septa to solutions capable of generating hydroxyl radicals resulted in more extensive and severe damage. Vascular endothelial cells showed evidence of vacuoles or blebs and edema. Severe swelling of mitochondria was evident in cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelial cells. In addition, myocytes often showed blebbing of the basement membrane.

Isoproterenol-induced relaxation took place with no change in cyclic GMP content. Hemoglobin and methylene blue appear therefore to inhibit selectively vaso-relaxation induced by agents which increase cyclic GMP levels.

Arachidonic acid relaxed phenylephrine-precontracted arterial rings and elevated both cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP levels in arteries with intact endothelium. In contrast, endothelium-damaged arterial rings contracted to arachidonic acid without demonstrating significant changes in cyclic nucleotide levels. Indomethacin partially inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxation and abolished cyclic AMP accumulation whereas methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, partially inhibited relaxation and abolished cyclic GMP accumulation in response to arachidonic acid. All vessel responses were blocked by a combination of the two inhibitors. Prostaglandin (PG) I2 relaxed arterial rings and elevated cyclic AMP levels whereas PGE2 and PGF2 alpha caused contraction, suggesting that the indomethacin-sensitive component of arachidonic acid-elicited relaxation is due to PGI2 formation and cyclic AMP accumulation. The methylene blue-sensitive component is attributed to an endothelium-dependent but cyclooxygenase-independent generation of a substance causing cyclic GMP accumulation. Intrapulmonary veins contracted to arachidonic acid with no changes in cyclic nucleotide levels and PGI2 was without effect. Homogenates of intrapulmonary artery and vein formed 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha and PGE2 from [14C]arachidonic acid, which was inhibited by indomethacin. Thus, bovine intrapulmonary vein may not possess receptors for PGI2.

For example, in the helical strip of the rabbit descending thoracic aorta, the only reported response to ACh has been graded contractions, occurring at concentrations above 0.1 muM and mediated by muscarinic receptors. Recently, we observed that in a ring preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta, ACh produced marked relaxation at concentrations lower than those required to produce contraction (confirming an earlier report by Jelliffe). In investigating this apparent discrepancy, we discovered that the loss of relaxation of ACh in the case of the strip was the result of unintentional rubbing of its intimal surface against foreign surfaces during its preparation. If care was taken to avoid rubbing of the intimal surface during preparation, the tissue, whether ring, transverse strip or helical strip, always exhibited relaxation to ACh, and the possibility was considered that rubbing of the intimal surface had removed endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that relaxation of isolated preparations of rabbit thoracic aorta and other blood vessels by ACh requires the presence of endothelial cells, and that ACh, acting on muscarinic receptors of these cells, stimulates release of a substance(s) that causes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle.

Recent evidence suggests that oxygen and/or activated oxygen species accelerate the evanescence of the factor. The biochemical mechanisms involved in the production of EDRF are still largely unknown. Both stimulators of phospholipase A2 and inhibitors of lysolecithin acyltransferase were found to induce EDRF-mediated relaxation, while several phospholipase inhibitors block these relaxations. These findings suggest that cleavage of phospholipids (and formation of free fatty acids and lysophosphatides) play an important role in EDRF production.

Following exposure of rabbit aortae (with intact endothelium) to the EDRF stimulators acetylcholine, A23187, or thimerosal, a humoral dilator compound could be assayed in the adventitial superfusate of the vessels.

The possibility that hemoglobin inhibits endothelium-dependent and glyceryl trinitrate-induced relaxation by binding EDRF and nitric oxide, respectively, is discussed together with the proposal that methylene blue might produce its effects by oxidizing a component of guanylate cyclase, possibly a ferrous heme group linked to the enzyme molecule.

The endothelium in muscular arteries from several species appears to have receptors for these vasodilators. Binding of one of these compounds to its endothelial receptors results in the release (and presumably synthesis) of substance(s) that act on arterial smooth muscle to cause relaxation. The name endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) has been proposed for the substance or substances responsible for inhibition of contraction. Studies to determine additivity of endothelium-dependent relaxing agents and sensitivity of EDRF-mediated responses to a variety of inhibitors suggest that a single factor or a single common mechanism induces relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Pharmacological studies have been equivocal with regard to the postulated involvement of phospholipases or arachidonic acid and to the suggestion that EDRF is an oxidative, non-cyclooxygenase product of arachidonate. Experiments on transfer of EDRF and reversal of endothelium-dependent relaxation consistently indicate that EDRF is quite labile. There is convincing evidence that EDRF activates smooth muscle guanylate cyclase, which results in an increase in intracellular cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels. The stimulation of guanylate cyclase by EDRF provides a valuable and sensitive parameter for studies with arteries as well as cells in culture.

EDRF was released from porcine aortic endothelial cells in culture and bioassayed on a cascade of superfused rabbit aortic strips. These compounds inhibited EDRF-induced relaxation of vascular strips, without affecting the relaxation induced by glyceryl trinitrate, and their inhibitory potency was markedly attenuated (by more than 1 order of magnitude) by the addition of superoxide dismutase (5-15 units/ml) or oxidized cytochrome c (20-40 microM) but not by catalase (30 units/ml) or heat-inactivated superoxide dismutase.

The endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) released by ACh and other agents has not yet been identified. Our original hypothesis that arachidonic acid is the precursor of EDRF is not supported by the finding that other unsaturated fatty acids in addition to arachidonic acid, and even stearic acid, elicited nonprostaglandin endothelium-dependent relaxations. Methylene blue and hemoglobin (but not methemoglobin) rapidly inhibited relaxation of rabbit aorta by ACh or A23187, suggesting that our proposal that EDRF is a labile free radical may be correct. The endothelium-dependent relaxation by each of these agents was shown to be preceded by an endothelium-dependent increase in cyclic GMP in the smooth muscle--a finding consistent with the hypothesis that EDRF stimulates guanylate cyclase in the muscle, leading to an increase in cyclic GMP that somehow activates relaxation.

Endothelial cells were collected from aortas by exposing the endothelial lining to collagenase 0.1%.

Endothelium-deprived aortic strips from rabbits were incubated in these cells suspended in tissue culture medium and fetal calf serum. The strips were precontracted with histamine. Acetylcholine was added to induce EDRF release. Significant relaxation of endothelium-deprived aortic strips was observed. Superoxide dismutase, an enzyme known to protect EDRF against inactivation, caused further relaxation, which was inhibited by the addition of hemoglobin, an agent known to inhibit the relaxing action of EDRF. Even without the addition of acetylcholine, hemoglobin caused contraction of the denuded aortic strips in suspension of porcine endothelial cells, demonstrating spontaneous EDRF release.

In contrast, cyanide inhibited only the responses to sodium nitroprusside. Increasing concentrations of methylene blue depressed resting arterial levels of cyclic GMP and caused slowly developing but marked contractions whereas cyanide was without effect.

Preincubation of dilute solutions of cyanide containing sodium nitroprusside in oxygenated Krebs' buffer at 37 degrees C for 15 min before addition to bath chambers depressed relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation caused by sodium nitroprusside markedly. Similar treatment of glyceryl trinitrate, however, failed to alter its effects in arterial rings.

Besides the ability to metabolize vasoactive compounds like catecholamines and angiotensins, endothelial cells possess an active biochemical machinery for the production of vasoactive compounds (e.g. prostacyclin). During recent years it has become apparent that a large variety of vasodilator compounds require intact endothelial cells to exert their relaxing action. These endothelium-dependent relaxations are not mediated by prostacyclin of endothelial origin, but by an unknown substance that is referred to as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). EDRF is a chemically unstable humoral substance and has a biological half-life in the range of seconds. Although EDRF is not a prostaglandin or leukotriene, several findings suggest possible relationships of its production with the eicosanoid system. Both stimulation of phospholipase A2 and inhibition of lysolecithin acyltransferase induce the production of EDRF. This suggests that cleavage of phospholipids may be an important step in the formation of EDRF. EDRF-mediated vascular relaxations (like relaxations induced by nitrovasodilators) were found to be associated with increases in cyclic GMP in vascular smooth muscle. Endothelial cells produce a factor that directly stimulates the enzymatic activity of soluble guanylate cyclase. Several points of evidence indicate that this factor may be identical with EDRF.

In the present study, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine were more potent as relaxants of venous than arterial segments. Each of these agents elevated tissue cyclic GMP levels, but not cyclic AMP levels, before relaxation. These nitrogen oxide-containing agents were more potent as elevators of cyclic GMP levels in venous than arterial tissue and this correlated generally with their effects on vascular smooth muscle tone. Methylene blue antagonized both relaxation and increased cyclic GMP levels elicited by nitroglycerin, nitroprusside and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. In contrast to the nitrogen oxide vasodilators, 8-bromo-cyclic GMP was equally effective in reducing induced tone in arterial or venous segments. Similarly, isoproterenol relaxed arterial and venous segments with equivalent sensitivities. Relaxation by isoproterenol was preceded by or occurred concomitantly with increased levels of cyclic AMP but not cyclic GMP and both effects were antagonized by propranolol.

Arachidonic acid relaxed phenylephrine-precontracted arterial rings and elevated both cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP levels in arteries with intact endothelium. In contrast, endothelium-damaged arterial rings contracted to arachidonic acid without demonstrating significant changes in cyclic nucleotide levels. Indomethacin partially inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxation and abolished cyclic AMP accumulation whereas methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, partially inhibited relaxation and abolished cyclic GMP accumulation in response to arachidonic acid. All vessel responses were blocked by a combination of the two inhibitors. Prostaglandin (PG) I2 relaxed arterial rings and elevated cyclic AMP levels whereas PGE2 and PGF2 alpha caused contraction, suggesting that the indomethacin-sensitive component of arachidonic acid-elicited relaxation is due to PGI2 formation and cyclic AMP accumulation. The methylene blue-sensitive component is attributed to an endothelium-dependent but cyclooxygenase-independent generation of a substance causing cyclic GMP accumulation. Intrapulmonary veins contracted to arachidonic acid with no changes in cyclic nucleotide levels and PGI2 was without effect. Homogenates of intrapulmonary artery and vein formed 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha and PGE2 from [14C]arachidonic acid, which was inhibited by indomethacin. Thus, bovine intrapulmonary vein may not possess receptors for PGI2.

In the case of the first two, which are strong agonists for the alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediating contraction, removal of endothelium increased sensitivity 4- and 6-fold at the EC30 level, but produced little or no increase in maximum. In the case of clonidine, a partial agonist for the alpha-1 adrenoceptor, which gave only about 15% of the maximum given by phenylephrine on endothelium-containing rings, removal of the endothelium not only shifted the curve to the left but also increased the maximum to about 50% of that given by phenylephrine. The depression of sensitivity to these agonists in rings with endothelium appeared to be due to the vasodepressor action of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), as hemoglobin, a specific blocking agent of EDRF, abolished this depression. It is unlikely that the endothelium-dependent depression was due to stimulation of release of EDRF, because clonidine did not produce endothelium-dependent relaxation in precontracted rings even when its contractile action was blocked by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Further evidence against alpha adrenoceptor agents stimulating release of EDRF was that neither phenylephrine nor clonidine induced a rise in cyclic GMP in aortic rings, whereas acetylcholine, which does release EDRF, caused a large rise in cyclic GMP content. The possibility that the muscle cells of intact rat aortic rings were under the tonic influence of released EDRF was supported by the finding that, in the absence of any contractile agent, hemoglobin induced a fall in the basal level of cyclic GMP in endothelium-containing rings.

The incubation period at the second i.e. passage in mice was reduced to 149 +/- 2 days. Studies were made of the dynamics of agent replication at 1st and 2nd passages in mice. At first passage, there was a 'zero phase' lasting about 175 days, when no infectious agent was detected in brain (or spleen), followed by a period of agent replication which lasted 150 days. At second passage, there was no significant 'zero phase' and agent replication occupied the whole of the incubation period.

The agent was stable in the nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and Nonidet P40 and stable in the nondenaturing, anionic detergents sodium cholate and sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate. In contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) inactivated the agent at high concentrations (1% or >) when the detergent-to-protein ration approached 1.5 g SDS/g protein. The agent was resistant to inactivation by nucleases and proteases, even in the presence of 0.1% SDS. A broad peak of infectivity was exhibited in modified colloidal silica (Percoll) density gradients. Maximal titers were found at a Percoll density of 1.10 g/cm3 in the presence and absence of 0.05% SDS. Gel electrophoresis of the agent in the presence of 0.1% SDS resulted in inactivation of > 95% of the agent loaded onto the gel. Free-flow electrophoresis showed that > 99% of the agent in fraction P5 migrated toward the anode, but not as a discrete species. Sedimentation analysis of the agent in fraction P5 in the presence of 1% lysolecithin showed that the agent has a sedimentation coefficient of < 300S but > 30S. Heating P5 preparations caused the agent to associate with cellular elements and form aggregates with sedimentation coefficients > 10,000S. Removal by differential centrifugation of the large forms of the agent produced upon heating permitted characterization of a discrete subpopulation of scrapie agent particles. Rate-zonal sucrose gradient studies showed that > 95% of the infectivity in this subpopulation sedimented as uniform particles with a sedimentation coefficient of 240S.", "pubdate_sims": "1980-09"}, "4967999": {"title": "Spread and scrapie by contact to goats and sheep.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1968-01"}, "4970192": {"title": "The sequential development of the brain lesion of scrapie in three strains of mice.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1968-07"}, "4961994": {"title": "The possible nature of the transmissible agent of scrapie.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1967-01-07"}, "4978935": {"title": "A comparison of some biological characteristics of the mouse-passaged scrapie agents, 22A and ME7.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1969-04"}, "4105437": {"title": "Slow infections of the central nervous system.

The present study has shown that ghost cyclase from adrenalectomized and hypophysectomized rats exhibits a striking reduction in response to ACTH, the stimulatory effects of epinephrine, glucagon, or fluoride being unchanged. Pretreatment of adrenalectomized, hypophysectomized, sham operated, or intact rats with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, selectively increased the ACTH response in ghost cyclase preparations. Cortisol, like dexamethasone, increased the ACTH response in ghosts from adrenalectomized rats; 11-deoxycorticosterone was ineffective. The dexamethasone effect to enhance the ACTH response is blocked by actinomycin D or cycloheximide. The present results show that stimulation of rat fat cell adenyl cyclase by ACTH involves a distinctive molecular entity, which can be clearly differentiated from adenyl cyclase in the membrane as well as from the selectivity sites for epinephrine and glucagon.

In the fat cells of rat adipose tissue, adenyl cyclase is stimulated by a number of hormones of disparate molecular structure, posing the question whether this cell type posesses multiple cyclase systems with distinctive specificities for individual hormones, or a single cyclase with broad specificity to a variety of hormones. Studies of the stimulatory effects of adenocorticotropin, glucagon, and epinephrine upon the adenyl cyclase of the rat fat cell \"ghosts\" (plasma membrane sacs) have shown that distinctive selectivity sites for each of these hormones can be differentiated. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent K\u00f6 592 abolished the stimulatory effect of epinephrine without influencing adenocorticotropin or glucagon; Ca was required for adenocorticotropin action, but not for glucagon or epinephrine.

Under these conditions catacholamines caused a 30--70% increase in GTP hydrolysis. The stimulation of GTPase activity by catecholamines required the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. DIfferent batches of membranes revealed the following specific activities (pmol 32Pi/mg protein min): basal GTPase (determined in the absence of catecholamine), 6-- 11; catecholamine-stimulated TTPase, 3--7; and residual non-specific NTPase 3--5. The stimulation of GTPase activity by catecholamines fulfilled the stereospecific requirements of the beta-adrenergic receptor, and was inhibited by propranolol. The concentrations of DL-isoproterenol which half-maximally activated the GTPase and adenylate cyclase were 1 and 1.2 muM, respectively. The following findings indicate that the catecholamine-stimulated GTPase is independent of the catalytic production of cyclic AMP by the adenylate cyclase. Addition of cyclic AMP to the GTPase assay did not change the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, treatment of the membrane with N-ethylmaleimide (MalNEt) at 0 degrees C which caused 98% inhibition of the adenylate cyclase, had no effect on the catecholamine-stimulated GTPase. The affinity and specificity for GTP in the GTPase reactions are similar to those previously reported for the stimulation of the adenylate cyclase.

Neither component by itself catalyzes the formation of cyclic AMP using MgATP as substrate. However, mixture of the two reconstitutes MgATP-dependent fluoride- and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p)-stimulatable adenylate cyclase activity. The more stable component can be resolved from the first in various tissues or cultured cells by treatment of membrnes or detergent extracts with heat or N-ethylmaleimide. The two proteins have also been resolved genetically in two clonal cell lines that are deficient in adenylate cyclase activity. An adenylate cyclase-deficient variant of the S49 lymphoma cell (AC-) contains only the thermolabile activity, while the activity of the more stable protein is found in a complementary hepatoma cell line (HC-1). In addition, AC-S49 cell plasma membranes contain MnATP-dependent adenylate cyclase activity. The protein that catalyzes this reaction appears to be the same as that which can combine with the thermostable component to reconstitute Mg2+-dependent enzyme activity because both activities co-fractionate by gel exclusion chromatography and sucrose density  gradient centrifugation, both activities have identical denaturation kinetics at 30 degrees C, and both activities are stabilized at 30 degrees C and labilized at 0 degree C by various nucleotides and divalent cations with similar specificity. It is thus hypothesized that the thermolabile factor is the catalytic subunit of the physiological adenylate cyclase and that the Mn2+-dependent activity is a nonphysiological expression of the catalytic protein. The thermostable moiety of the enzyme, which is proposed to serve a regulatory function, appears to consist of two functional components, based upon differential thermal lability of its ability to reconstitute hormone-, NaF-, or Gpp(NH)p-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These components have not, however, been physically separated. The thermolabile and thermostable components can interact in detergent solution or in a suitable membrane. Mixing of the detergent-solubilized regulatory component with AC-membranes that contain only the catalytic protein and beta-adrenergic receptors reconstitutes catecholamine-stimulatable adenylate cyclase activity; however, addition of the catalytic protein to membranes that contain receptor and the regulatory component yields MgATP-dependent enzymatic activity that is unresponsive to hormone.", "pubdate_sims": "1978-09-25"}, "13398422": {"title": "The relationship of epinephrine and glucagon to liver phosphorylase.

As the binding of cholera toxin is rapid, two possible rate-limiting steps could be the determinants of the long time course of action.

This nonuniform representation has been characterized in more detail with self-annealed, total cell DNA extracted 18 hr after adenovirus type 2 infection: the concentration of single-stranded sequences homologous to different regions of the viral genome was determined by comparing the rates of hybridization of 32P-labeled, single-stranded DNA probes with such self-annealed 18 hr DNA to the rates of hybridization of the same probes with equal concentrations of their complements. This approach allows the concentration of single-stranded viral DNA sequences in excess of their complements to be determined. Such sequences can be represented by two concentration gradients across the viral genome: those homologous to the r strand increase in concentration from 27.8-40.9 units toward the right end, whereas sequences homologous to the 1 strand increase from an area 27.8-40.9 units toward the left end. The time course of synthesis of single-stranded viral DNA sequences relative to accumulation of total viral DNA during the productive cycle and their behavior following a shift of H5ts125-infected cells in which viral DNA replication has begun from a permissive to a nonpermissive temperature support the contention that these sequences are indeed generated as adenovirus DNA is replicated. These results are therefore discussed in terms of current models of adenovirus DNA replication.", "pubdate_sims": "1976-12"}, "978800": {"title": "Genome expression and mRNA maturation at late stages of productive adenovirus type 2 infection.", "abstract": "RNA from adenovirus 2-infected KB cells was annealed in liquid with RNA in vast excess to viral heavy (l) and light (r) 32P-labeled DNA strands. Hybridization kinetics were analyzed by computer to estimate the number of viral RNA abundance classes, their relative concentrations, and the fraction of each DNA strand from which they originated. Early whole cell RNA extracted 5 h postinfection annealed rapidly to 10 to 15% of l and r strands and then slowly to final values of 60 and 40% of l and r strands. By 9 h postinfection the expression of late genes was apparent and whole cell RNA annealed to 20 and 75% of l and r strands. Whole cell RNA extracted between 12 and 36 h postinfection annealed to 7 to 15% and 75 to 90% of l and r strands. Late nuclear RNA hybridized to 10 and 90% of l and r strands, and late polyribosomal RNA hybridized to 20 and 75% of l and r strands. Based upon kinetic analyses, we estimate that mRNA synthesized exclusively during late stages arises from about 6 to 8% and 45 to 49% of l and r strands. This assumes that the early class I mRNA (in low concentration late) originates from 8 to 10% and 6 to 10% of l and r strands and that early class II mRNA (in high concentration late) is derived from 2% and 8 to 13% of l and r strands. Mixing experiments indicated that early mRNA is a subset of RNA extracted from polyribosomes late after infection and that late nuclear RNA contains sequences complementary to early l strand class I nRNA. RNA-RNA hybrids were isolated from late mRNA containing sequences from 60% of l and r strands, but it is not known when these were synthesized, and therefore whether complementary RNA transcripts are synthesized late after infection, as they are known to be synthesized early. These results demonstrate that portions of the genome are transcribed into RNA sequences that remain confined to the nucleus and are not exported to polyribosomes as mRNA.", "pubdate_sims": "1976-11"}, "864829": {"title": "Fidelity of adenovirus RNA transcription in isolated HeLa cell nuclei.", "abstract": "An in vitro nuclear system from adenovirus type 2-infected cells was developed to study transcription of viral RNA.

Three RNA species were identified in a 16S to 18S size class, and a fourth size class, 11S to 13S, was resolved into two components. The SmaI-D region (0.38 to 0.51 on the unit genome) and the EcoRI-F, D region (0.70 to 0.83) of the genome were found to code for multiple transcripts. Three RNAs (28S, 22S, and 18S) are specified by SmaI-D, and four components, 28S, 22S, 18S, and 16S, are encoded by EcoRI-F,D. The RNA represented by each set of multiple transcripts exceeds the coding capacity of the respective region, and the species within each set of RNAs appear to contain common sequences. The relationship between the cytoplasmic RNA species synthesized at late times and early cytoplasmic RNAs was determined by hybridization-inhibition experiments.

A duplex stem of length 115 +/- 10 nucleotide pairs due to pairing between the two members of the inverted terminal repetition is observed in the single-stranded circles that form upon annealing single-stranded linear molecules. This duplex stem is shown to lie at the ends of the DNA by using several reference markers: (i) a newly discovered secondary structure feature (a loop of length ca. 500 nucleotides with a 20-nucleotide pair duplex stem) that maps 73% of the full length from the left end of the molecule and (ii) a duplex region due to a hybridized restriction fragment. There is also some secondary structure within each end of linear single strands. There is some variation in the morphology of the end strucures, and we propose that these involve base pairing, as in a tRNA clover leaf, rather than an exact single hairpin-type inverted repeat.

In standard saline the major fraction of the action potential disappeared either upon omission of external Na ions from standard saline or addition of 1 muM tetrodotoxin (TTX). We conclude that action potentials in the chromaffin cell are due mainly to an increase in the permeability of the membrane to Na ions. 4. Small but significant regenerative action potentials were observed in Na-free saline, and when Ca in Na-free saline was replaced by Ba, prolonged action potentials occurred. We conclude that action potentials in the chromaffin cell also have a Ca component. 5.

The shunt resistance of the suction pipette was 10-50 times the neuronal membrane resistance, and the series resistance of the system, which was largely due to the tip diameter, was about 10(5) omega. However, the peak clamp currents were only about 20 nA for a 60-mV voltage step so that measurements of membrane voltage were accurate to within at least 3%. Spatial control of voltage was achieved only after somal separation, and nerve cell bodies isolated in this way do not generate all-or-none action potentials. Measurements of membrane potential, membrane resistance, and membrane time constant are equivalent to those obtained using intracellular micropipettes, the customary method. With the axon attached, comparable all-or-none action potentials were also measured by either method. Complete exchange of Cs+ for K+ was accomplished by internal perfusion and allowed K+ currents to be blocked. Na+ currents could then be blocked by TTX or suppressed by Tris-substituted snail Ringer solution.

Analysis of such conductance fluctuations provides a way to assess the validity of various microscopic models for the behavior of individual channels. Two different probabilistic interpretations of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations are investigated here and shown to yield different predictions about the spectrum of conductance fluctuations; thus, appropriate noise measurements may serve to eliminate certain classes of microscopic models for membrane conductance changes.

Characteristics of the transmembrane ionic currents under controlled changes in ionic composition of extra- and intracellular medium were studied in isolated neurones from the ganglia of molluscs, Helix pomatia, Limnea stagnalis and Planorbis corneus. The neurones were investigated by a new technique which allows for dialysis of their interior and for clamping of the potential at the surface membrane without using micro-electrodes.2. Replacement of K ions by Tris inside the neurones eliminated the outward K current so that the actual time course of the inward current could be measured. The latter was separated into two additive components, one of which was carried by Na ions and the other one by Ca ions.3. Both inward currents were unaltered by tetrodotoxin (TTX); however, Ca current could be separately blocked by externally applied Cd ions (K(d) = 7.2 x 10(-5)M) and by the use of fluoride as an intracellular anion.4. No reversal of Na inward current could be achieved in neurones dialysed with Na-free solution, indicating the absence of outward current carrying ions through the corresponding channels. With 5 mM-Na inside the cell, the equilibrium potential was close to the value predicted by the Nernst equilibrium.5. A non-specific outward current could be detected in K-free cells at membrane potentials exceeding 20-40 mV. Its time course was proportional to 1 - exp (-t/tau(ns)). Cd ions depressed this current. The presence of the non-specific outward current made an exact measurement of the equilibrium potential for the Ca inward current impossible.6. The kinetics of Na inward currents could be described by m(3)h and those of the Ca current by m(2)h law.

There are no discrete classes of \"bound water\" in this system; the work of removal is a continuous function of water content and lattice repeat spacing. From 30 to 3 A separation between bilayers there exists an exponential \"hydration force\" repulsion with a 2.6 A decay length. This interaction translates into a very large force to prevent contact between vesicles and planar membranes. It may be an important feature in controlling vesicle-to-cell fusion. As water is removed, bilayers not only move closer, but thicken as the lipid polar groups on the same bilayer move closer together. It is possible to divide the applied work into that of direct bilayer repulsion and that of bilayer deformation. We thus obtained a first determination of the lateral pressure required to create large increases in bilayer thickness and concomitant decreases in bilayer area. The lateral pressure reaches 25 dynes/cm for a 25% decrease in bilayer area.

The expression of one gene in the cluster precludes the expression of any other linked gene. A simple, testable theory of gene selection called \"looping-out excision\"which was designed only to explain this mutual exclusivity in the hemoglobin system is described. The theory is closely concordant with a wide range of previously unexplained findings concerning hematopoiesis- including the developmental changes of hemoglobins, the increases in immature or fetal forms of hemoglobin that accompany anemia, and with the distribution of adult and fetal hemoglobins among erythrocytes during normal embryogenesis and in various pathological conditions. One corollary of this theory is that erythroid tissue in the normal adult bone marrow is constantly recapitulating the developmental stages of its embryogenesis. Another corollary is that the selection from among the linked globin genes occurs independently on the two chromosomes of the diploid organism. Both of these corollaries are supported by the available data. The same theory of gene selection is also remarkably consistent with known data for immunoglobulin synthesis; it could explain not only the mutually exclusive activation of linked variable genes but also the splicing which occurs between genetically linked variable and constant region genes for the immunoglobulin polypeptide chains. The agreement between these two different tissues is considered to be strong evidence that the proposed mechanism is correct at least in broad outline. Evidence from the genetics of maize and of drosophila also supports this theory of somatic tissue variegation.

Hybridization of purified mRNA coding for immunoglobulin heavy chain (mRNA-H) with a vast excess of DNA confirms the existence of a single C gene of each type and multiple V genes. A large number (of the order of 104) of V genes would be consistent with the hybridization results. This suggests considerable V gene redundancy which is a predictable property of a multiple V gene family maintained by expansion and contraction mechanisms.

Further, gammaG responses could be almost completely suppressed by antibody as long as 48 hr after initiation of cultures, whereas gammaM PFC responses could only be completely suppressed during the first 24 hr.

These mice are phenotypically negative for serum Ig-1b, the paternal allotype determinant on gammaG(2a) immunoglubulin, as a result of perinatal exposure to maternal anti-Ig-1b. When spleen or bone marrow (B) cells from suppressed mice were injected into irradiated BALB/c \"indicator\" hosts, detectable levels of Ig-1b were demonstrated in the sera of a majority of the recipients early after transfer. These results indicate that Ig-1b-producing cells or their precursors are present in the lymphoid tissues of suppressed mice, even though they are not expressed. Within 5-7 wk, it was no longer possible to detect Ig-1b in the sera of these hosts, although cells producing another paternal allotype (Ig-4b) were shown to persist. Control BALB/c mice, injected with spleen and B cells from normal mice, continued to produce high levels of immunoglobulin carrying this allotype. The disappearance of serum, Ig-1b occurred most frequently in the recipients of suppressed spleen cells. Similar results were obtained using a mixture of spleen cells from normal and suppressed mice. Ig-1b production in the recipient mice ceased within a few weeks, even though the majority of cells in the mixture were obtained from normal (nonsuppressed) donors. The data are interpreted as evidence that chronic allotype suppression in mice is actively maintained by cells which are resident in the lymphoid tissues, splenic cells being the most effective.

The incorporation of (14)C from [1-(14)C]arachidonic acid into PGE(2) by the microsomal fraction was enhanced by EDTA. This apparent increase in (14)C incorporation into PGE(2) in the presence of EDTA could be due at least in part to its chelating properties of removing the divalent cations in the homogenate that enhance the selective formation of PGF(2alpha) and the suppression of the activity of epidermal phospholipase A, which causes the release of nonradioactive fatty acid precursors from endogenous phospholipids.

The incorporation of (14)C from [1-(14)C]arachidonic acid into PGE(2) by the microsomal fraction was enhanced by EDTA. This apparent increase in (14)C incorporation into PGE(2) in the presence of EDTA could be due at least in part to its chelating properties of removing the divalent cations in the homogenate that enhance the selective formation of PGF(2alpha) and the suppression of the activity of epidermal phospholipase A, which causes the release of nonradioactive fatty acid precursors from endogenous phospholipids. This study has also demonstrated that the formation of PGE(2) from arachidonic acid by the microsomal fraction from human skin could be inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a possible regulatory role of fatty acids released from endogenous phospholipids on prostaglandin synthesis in this tissue.

In contrast, the cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine chloride enhanced enzyme secretion, an effect blocked by 10(-6) M atropine. Incubation of cells with exogenous cAMP or with agents that increase endogenous cAMP levels (prostaglandin E1, histamine, isoproterenol, and cholera enterotoxin) reduced extrusion of lysosomal enzymes; in contrast, exogenous cGMP and carbamylcholine chloride (which increases endogenous cGMP levels), increased beta-glucuronidase release.

The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids. Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid.

Contact of neutrophils with zymosan-treated serum or the divalent cation ionophore A-23187, in the presence of extracellular calcium, resulted in beta-glucuronidase (beta-D-glucuronide glucuronosohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.31) secretion and a concomitant accumulation of cyclic GMP without any loss of cell viability. Acetylcholine (0.1 muM), in the presence of calcium, enhanced the immunologic stimulation of cyclic GMP accumulation and lysosomal enzyme discharge. A marked and rapid association of 45CaCl2 with neutrophils occurred during cell surface contact with zymosan-treated serum, and this effect on calcium association was enhanced with 0.1 muM acetylcholine. The precise mechanism of the neutrophil-calcium interaction is presently not well understood. However, the finding that 0.5-1.0 muM A-23187 also provoked a rapid association of extracellular calcium with neutrophils suggests that calcium mobilization into the intracellular environment may account, at least in part, for this association between cells and calcium. The close temporal relationship between beta-glucuronidase secretion, cyclic GMP accumulation, and calcium mobilization during cell contact with membrane active agents such as immune reactants, acetylcholine, and ionophores suggests that these three cellular events bear a cause and effect relationship.

The inhibition induced by dexamethasone, indomethacin and 1-P-3-P is reduced by an increase in the calcium concentration from 1 mM to 5 mM, whereas the inhibition induced by ETA is increased. 5 The results suggest that a lipoxygenase is important in the synthesis and release by SRS-A.", "pubdate_sims": "1979-01"}, "55439": {"title": "The effect of thiols on the immunologic release of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis.

Pretreatment of rats with cysteine also enhanced the IgGa-and anti-rat IgE-mediated release of SRS-A in vivo in the rat.

Cell separation studies revealed that granulocytes other than basophils were also capable of releasing SRS-A. The contractile activity released after challenge with ionophore appeared physicochemically identical to the SRS-A of rat or human origin released by antigen challenge in terms of its stability to base hydrolysis, inactivation by arylsulfatase, and chromatographic behavior on silicic acid and Sephadex LH-20 columns.

This production of slow reacting substance could be inhibited by the addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g., indomethacin, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, Furthermore, mediator production was inhibited by eicosatetraynoic acid, the substrate analog of arachidonic acid, and by 9,11-azoprosta-5, 13-dienoic acid (AZO analog 1), a structural analog of the prostaglandin endoperoxide, PGH2, which known to inhibit thromboxane synthesis. Relatively high concentrations of hydrocortisone acetate inhibited mediator production; this inhibition could be partly reversed by the addition of arachidonic acid or to a lesser extent by eicosatrienoic acid. Preliminary results suggest that a  small fraction of the 3H-labled arachidonic acid which was taken up by these cells in vitro was associated with slow reacting substance.

Addition of 10 vol of methanol, ethanol, or ethylene glycol to short-term incubations (30-45 sec) led to the formation of the corresponding 12-O-alkyl derivatives of the 5,12-dihydroxy acids. The time for 50% disappearance of the intermediate (37 degrees C), as measured by formation of 5-hydroxy-12-O-methylicosatetraenoic acids (two isomers) upon trapping with methanol, was about 1 min in live cell preparations (pH 7.4) and about 4 min in water/acetone (1:1), pH 7.4. At pH 6.0 or below, the hydrolysis of the intermediate was too rapid to be measured by the method employed.

striate cortex.", "abstract": "1. the striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. on the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. a small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. they are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. in the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. the ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. there is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. a horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. the upper layers (ii and the upper two-thirds of iii) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. the cells are mostly binocularly driven. simple cells are found deep in layer iii, and in iv a and iv b. in layer iv b they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. in layers iv a and iv b one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. in layer iv most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. layers v and vi contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. the cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. in the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. the horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer iv, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1968-03", "references": ["4961644", "14403678", "14283058", "17793797", "13716437", "13955384", "13571364", "5972183", "5883731",

The angle of orientation between them could be changed. The threshold of one grating, the test grating, was determined in the presence of the other, the masking grating.3. When the gratings were presented with the same orientation (and locked in phase) the increment threshold of the test grating was found to be proportional to the suprathreshold contrast of the masking grating.4. As the angle between the test and masking gratings was increased the masking effect fell exponentially.5. At 12 degrees on either side of a vertical test grating the masking effect was reduced by a factor of two with respect to its maximum value. This angle was independent of the contrast level of masking, the focus, and also the phase coherence of the masking grating.6.

It is seen in this study that retinal lesions of the fovea and adjacent parafovea produce a more severe drop in acuity than corresponding cortical lesions, and therefore the surprisingly slight effects of the latter cannot be explained in terms of a relatively higher parafoveal acuity in the monkey.

A survey of the properties of retinal ganglion cells in the central part of the rabbit retina has been carried out.2. The five types of unit previously encountered in the peripheral retina were also found in the central region. Their receptive fields were smaller, and tended to be oval-shaped with the long axis horizontal.3. In addition, three new types were discovered: orientation-selective cells, local-edge-detectors, uniformity-detectors.4. Orientation-selective cells were sensitive to either vertically or horizontally extended targets. Analysis suggested they were modified concentric units with an incomplete antagonistic surround.5. Local-edge-detectors responded to the appearance or movement of a contrasting border within the receptive field. They were inhibited by similar stimulation of the region surrounding the receptive field. Detailed attention was given to the demonstration of edge-detection.6.

Enhancement by mycobacterial adjuvants. Incorporation of tubercle bacilli with picrylated proteins in adjuvant-antigen emulsions stimulated the development of this cellular hypersensitivity to antigen. 3.

At the same time the cells lose amino acids and ribonucleotides and become fully permeable to the Na(+) of the medium. When antibody + C' acts in a low protein medium, the cells swell extensively and lose most of their macromolecules to the medium (hemoglobin from erythrocytes, protein and RNA from the ascites tumor cells). If the antibody + C' acts in a medium containing protein in sufficient concentration to balance the colloid osmotic pressure of the cells, the swelling is prevented; no macromolecules are then lost from the cells, but the loss of K(+) and entrance of Na(+) are not altered, and the loss of amino acids and ribonucleotides is only slightly affected. It therefore appears that the action of antibody + C' is to produce functional \"holes\" in the animal cell membrane which permit the equilibration of cations and small molecules between cell and medium.

The highly heterogeneous fragments could be divided into two groups with distinct antigenic determinants (S and F), which were separated by DEAE ion-exchange cellulose chromatography. Approximately two-thirds of the fragments had S antigenic groupings and one-third had F antigenic groupings. These data are consistent with the view that mouse gamma globulin is split by papain and cysteine into three major fragments, two of which are of the S type and one of the F type. Antibody activity of the original molecule was present in the S fragments. Although the S fragments did not precipitate the antigen (hemocyanin) they were shown to bind antigen specifically in the manner of univalent antibodies. The S fragments of normal gamma-globulin were very heterogeneous with a broad spectrum of electrophoretic mobilities. Comparison of S fragments from slow and fast migrating globulins showed that the mobilities of the original gamma-globulin samples were largely reflected in the mobilities of their S fragments. Additional observations indicated that the F fragments also may help to determine the electrophoretic mobility of intact gamma-globulin molecules. S fragments of differing electrophoretic mobility were shown to have the same antigenic determinants, indicating that the structural differences responsible for the electrophoretic mobility differences were not involved in the antigenic groupings identified with rabbit antisera. The F fragments of normal gamma-globulin migrated more rapidly than the S fragments, were less heterogeneous, and showed several bands on starch gel electrophoresis. The F fragments differed antigenically from the S fragments, and had no antibody activity. Two groups of F fragments (F and F') were detected with some antisera. The gamma-myeloma protein (5563) formed in a C(3)H plasma cell tumor and similarly fragmented by treatment with papain and cysteine, produced much more discrete S and F components than were found in the normal gamma-globulin digest. The electrophoretic properties of the myeloma protein fragments were within the range observed for normal gamma-globulin fragments. Although the gamma-myeloma protein shares antigenic determinants with normal gamma-globulins it lacks some of the antigenic groupings present in the gamma-globulin preparation. Both S and F fragments from the myeloma protein share antigenic determinants with the corresponding fragments from normal gamma-globulin.

The technique of immunoelectrophoresis was particularly useful for bringing out the different antigenic constituents obtained after papain treatment. The F and S components as well as a midfraction were isolated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose.

The relative amount of F and S antibodies varied in different antisera from individual rabbits immunized with whole gamma-globulin.

The F components of the two gamma-globulins were similar in mobility, while the S components showed marked mobility differences although antigenically they were very similar. The mobility differences of the parent gamma-globulin appeared to be primarily related to the differences in the S component.

The 7S gamma myeloma globulins were either immunological type I or II. The papain digests of these proteins produced the S and F precipitin lines in immunoelectrophoresis but multiple bands in starch gel electrophoresis, especially in the F region. The S fraction of type I myeloma globulins is antigenically similar to Bence Jones protein of type B, and the S component of type II myeloma globulins has antigenic determinants in common with type A Bence Jones protein. Correspondingly, myeloma patients with type I globulins and proteinuria usually excrete type B Bence Jones proteins, whereas patients with type II excrete type A proteins. The F fragment is the part common to normal 7S gamma-globulin and types I and II myeloma globulins but is absent in beta(2A) and beta(2M) pathological globulins and in both types of Bence Jones proteins. Papain digests of beta(2A) myeloma globulins produced a single precipitin line in immunoelectrophoresis. beta(2A) myeloma globulins appeared to have two antigenic units, one in common with type B Bence Jones protein and normal gamma-globulin, and another specific to beta(2A). The beta(2A) myeloma patients excreted type B Bence Jones protein. The papain digest of a macroglobulin produced two precipitin lines, the faster of which had antigenic determinants in common with type B Bence Jones protein, the slower seemed specific for the macroglobulin. Five serum micromolecular globulins proved to be either type A or B Bence Jones proteins. From the above results, an antigenic map was constructed showing which determinants are shared and which are specific for normal 7S gamma-globulin, types I and II myeloma globulins, beta(2A) myeloma globulins, a macroglobulin, and types A and B Bence Jones proteins.", "pubdate_sims": "1963-01-01"}, "13897619": {"title": "Delayed hypersensitivity to hapten-protein conjugates. I. The effect of carrier protein and site of attachment to hapten.", "abstract": "Further data have been presented showing that the specificity of the delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the guinea pig to hapten-protein conjugates involves to a considerable degree a contribution by the protein carrier. The carrier contribution is such that sensitization to guinea pig albumin-m-azobenzenesulfonate, for example, does not result in cross-reaction with conjugates of the same hapten with unrelated proteins such as ovalbumin or human gamma globulin, nor were cross-reactions observed between conjugates prepared with the same hapten, coupled to the same protein, but by two different chemical routes, such that the point of attachment of the hapten to the protein differed. It thus appears that in this system both hapten and carrier protein are necessary, but that neither alone is in general sufficient to stimulate the delayed sensitive cell. Desensitization experiments with cross-reacting hapten-protein conjugates have suggested the presence of a multiplicity of antigenic determinants participating in the elicitation of the delayed lesion, and of a concomitant development of a heterogeneity of specificities in the population of delayed sensitive cells in the sensitized animal. The data are discussed in terms of the apparent requirement of the delayed sensitivity mechanism for a larger functional antigenic determinant than that required for interaction with circulating antibodies. Some possible explanations for this difference, and some of its consequences, are discussed.", "pubdate_sims": "1962-05-01"}, "13930142": {"title": "Studies on the dimensions of the rabbit antibenzylpenicilloyl antibody-combing sites.", "abstract": "Rabbit antisera prepared against conjugates of the benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) bifunctional haptenic group were analyzed to determine whether the antibodies are adapted to only a portion of the large BPO molecule, or to the entire molecule, and whether specificity extends to the lysine side chain and adjoining structures of the immunizing carrier protein. No antibodies adapted to the phenylacetylamine portion of the BPO group could be detected in a pooled rabbit anti-BPO serum globulin fraction by PCA and quantitative precipitin analysis using several phenylacetylamine-protein conjugates as antigens. No antibodies adapted only to the thiazolidine carboxylic acid portion of the BPO molecule were detected in the anti-BPO globulin fraction using quantitative precipitin and hapten inhibition methods. At least the bulk of the anti-BPO antibodies was found to be adapted to the entire BPO haptenic group. By quantitative hapten inhibition of precipitation of the anti-BPO globulin fraction, the anti-BPO antibodies were found to show specificity for a 6 carbon amide side chain corresponding to the lysine side chain through which BPO groups are bound predominantly to protein. The contribution of this 6 carbon chain to antibody-hapten binding was small; (-DeltaF degrees ) was calculated to be 460 calories per mole (average). Rabbit anti-BPO antibodies prepared against BPO-rabbit serum albumin conjugates showed specificity also toward structures of the immunizing carrier protein, and possibly toward secondary or tertiary structural configurations. Penicilloyl conjugates of rabbit serum albumin precipitated from 3 individual rabbit antisera more anti-BPO antibodies than did penicilloyl conjugates of heterologous carriers (poly-L-lysine, human serum albumin, and human gamma-globulin). Anti-BPO antibodies demonstrated heterogeneity with regard to closeness of fit to the haptenic group, or with regard to the dimensions of the combining sites, or both. It was concluded that at least a large part of anti-BPO antibodies are specifically adapted to a large antigenic unit comprised of the entire BPO group, the lysine side chain, and structural configurations of the immunizing carrier protein.", "pubdate_sims": "1963-01-01"}, "13304242": {"title": "Sites of antibody production in the guinea-pig; the relation between in vitro synthesis of anti-ovalbumin and gamma-globulin and distribution of antibody-containing plasma cells.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1956-02"}, "13966867": {"title": "Immunological unresponsiveness produced in adult guinea pigs by parenteral introduction of minute quantities of hapten or protein antigen.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1962-10"}, "13995245": {"title": "Antibody formation.

Formation of rapidly and slowly sedimenting antibodies and immunological memory to bacteriophage phi-X 174.", "abstract": "Injection of a sufficient dose of bacteriophage phiX 174 into guinea pigs results in the formation of rapidly sedimenting antibody molecules (19S), and later, slowly sedimenting molecules (7S). Above a threshold dose of antigen, the relative rate of 19S formation is maximal and dose-independent; below this dose, slower relative rates are obtained. The time for doubling the serum 19S level is as short as 6 to 8 hours, suggesting that the absolute rate of antibody formation per cell is increasing in addition to proliferation of antibody-producing cells. Synthesis of 19S after injection of 10(10) phiX virtually ceases at 10 days after which 19S antibody activity disappears from the circulation with a half-life of approximately 24 hours. A second injection of phiX on day 5 or 9 prolongs 19S synthesis, indicating that antigen not only can regulate the relative rate, but also is essential for continued synthesis of 19S. 19S synthesis is also prolonged in guinea pigs by injection of phiX with endotoxin or by 400 r whole body x-irradiation 24 hours after injection of phage into rabbits. The primary 7S response is not detected until approximately 1 week after immunization and relative rates are antigen-dependent. Primary 7S synthesis can continue for many months and leads to preparation for a secondary antibody response (immunological memory) during which only 7S is detected. In contrast, in animals that form precipitating 19S without detectable 7S, a second injection of phage 1 month later results in a second 19S response which closely resembles the first. These findings have led to the suggestion that formation of 19S does not lead to persisting immunological memory.", "pubdate_sims": "1963-03-01"}, "14367678": {"title": "The use of precipitin analysis in agar for the study of human streptococcal infections.

Most of those showing no bands, had very low antistreptolysin titers. A correlation was found between the migration rates of these bands and the antistreptolysin titer. A strong trend toward a straight line relationship was apparent when the ASO titers were plotted on a logarithmic scale. In addition, a roughly positive correlation was found between the intensity of these bands and the antistreptolysin O titers. The finding of high levels of antistreptolysin O activity and slowly migrating heavy bands in normal pooled human gamma globulin supported the above observations. Very similar results were obtained with rabbit and guinea pig sera after immunization with the streptolysin O concentrates. The data strongly indicate that antistreptolysin O activity in human sera is generally due to precipitating antibody, and that non-specific inhibitors are not usually involved, even with low titered sera. Rabbit and guinea pig antisera to the oxidized inactive and to the reduced active forms of streptolysin O showed no obvious differences.

This precipitin could be absorbed from sera with normal human heart tissue homogenates but not with homogenates of other organs. Demonstration of this cross-reaction by heart absorption was found dependent both upon the serologic properties of individual sera and the nature or state of purification of the streptococcal product employed as test antigen. Evidence was obtained of a close association of heart-related and non-heart-related antigenic determinants in partially purified preparations of the streptococcal antigen by both gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis. On immunoelectrophoretic analysis, cross-reactive antigen exhibited a more rapid mobility toward the anode than M protein. It was destroyed by digestion with trypsin, pepsin, and chymotrypsin. Based on specific absorption tests with a Type 5 and Type 19 strain, the antigen was localized to cell walls and to a lesser extent to cell membranes of these strains. Precipitating activity related to cross-reactive antibody was localized to the immunoglobulin zone in immunoelectrophoresis. Reactive sera showed diminution or loss of serological activity following heat inactivation at 56 degrees C or after prolonged storage at 4 degrees C. Sera containing cross-reactive precipitating antibody exhibited an immunofluorescent reaction with sarcolemma of cardiac myofibers, which was inhibited by streptococcal cross-reactive antigen. By this inhibition test, the immunofluorescent reaction related to cross-reactive antibody could be distinguished from that due to other heart-reactive factors. Antibody to streptococcal cross-reactive antigen defined by precipitation-absorption tests was observed in 24 per cent of patients with recent history of uncomplicated streptococcal infection and in the majority of patients with acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, or acute glomerulonephritis. It was observed rarely in patients with non-streptococcal related disease. These data provide evidence that induction of cross-reactive autoantibody to heart in certain individuals is associated with streptococcal infection.", "pubdate_sims": "1964-04-01"}, "14165322": {"title": "INTERACTION OF MENINGOPNEUMONITIS VIRUS WITH WHITE BLOOD CELLS.

An antibody to the antigen MuB1 can also be elicited in rabbits. 99 strains and substrains of inbred mice were tested for the presence of MuB1; the antigen was found in the sera of 44 strains (61 per cent) and 14 DBA substrains (52 per cent). Evidence is presented indicating that mice lacking MuB1 do not make a modified antigen, corresponding to MuB1, but are genetically deficient in synthetic ability at this site. By reaction with antibody to MuB1 an antigen corresponding to MuB1 was found in 13 of the 15 orders of mammals, and in 63 of 85 mammalian species tested, including man and guinea pig. The quantity of the antigen MuB1 is always greater in the serum of male than in the serum of female mice. The concentration of MuB1 increases with age; this increase is more marked in male than in female mice. By means of backcross experiments it was shown that the inheritance of MuB1 is unifactorial, is independent of the inheritance of the gamma globulin allotype MuA2, and is qualitatively independent of the sex of the parents. The antigen MuB1 is found in the euglobulin fraction of serum; it loses its ability to precipitate with antibody after heating at 56 degrees C, but not after treatment with ammonia or hydrazine. By gel filtration, MuB1 is separated with a fraction containing molecules of molecular weight approximately 150,000. An empirical correlation was observed between the presence or absence of MuB1 in the sera from inbred mice and the presence or absence of hemolytic complement (Hc), as measured by a test using a high concentration of rabbit hemolysin. In backcross experiments also, a correlation between hemolytic complement and the presence of MuB1 was demonstrated. As with MuB1, male mice had a higher hemolytic complement level than females. The particular component of complement which may be identical with MuB1 has not been identified.", "pubdate_sims": "1964-11-01"}, "14110697": {"title": "THE DISTRIBUTION OF GC-TYPES IN SERA FROM AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1963-06"}, "14082552": {"title": "IMMUNOLOGIC STUDIES OF INTRINSIC FACTOR.

Heating also releases some small RNAs from 30-40S RNA of virus harvested at 3-min intervals, but five times more 4S RNA is released if the 30-40S RNA is allowed to convert to 60-70S in the virus. The template activity for Rous virus DNA polymerase of the 30-40S RNA of Rous virus harvested at 3-min intervals is about five times lower than that of 60-70S RNA. It is suggested that association of 30-40S RNAs with some RNAs of the 4-12S class may take place simultaneously with their conversion to 60-70S RNA.", "pubdate_sims": "1973-02"}, "57621": {"title": "Pheasant virus: new class of ribodeoxyvirus.", "abstract": "Cocultivation of cells derived from embryos of golden pheasants or Amherst pheasants with chicken embryo cells infected with Bryan strain of Rous sarcoma virus resulted in the detection of viruses which appear to be endogenous in these pheasant cells.

Sensitivity of the endogenous RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity to a low concentration of pancreatic RNase indicated that the enzyme utilized the td virus endogenous RNA as template. Maximal DNA synthesis was observed in a reaction mixture of pH 8 - 8.5 at 45 C with a manganese concentration of 1 mM. The enzyme of the td virus responded to exogenous template-primers in a manner characteristic of DNA polymerase of RNA tumor viruses, and the response became substantially greater when noncomplementary precursors were omitted from the reaction mixture. The endogenous reaction kinetics were examined. Three phases of DNA synthesis could be distinguished. Evidence was obtained showing that during the third and slowest phase of DNA synthesis the reaction mixture was not depleted of precursors and that the enzyme was fully active to initiate DNA synthesis with newly-added viral or synthetic RNA templates. Comparison of TMP and dAMP incorporation kinetics suggested that at the initial phase the enzyme preferentially copies A-rich region(s) of viral RNA. A comparison was also made between the endogenous reaction of the td virus and that of its parent sarcoma virus. The pH optimum, metal ion requirements, effect of sulfhydryl agents, response to exogenous template-primers, and kinetics of DNA synthesis, were all compared.

The reduction in infectivity seen with 2',5'A4 nucleotides is paralleled by a smaller but significant (three- to four-fold) reduction in the amount of particles released as measured by reverse transcriptase activity and levels of viral structural proteins. The reduced infectivity of released particles is not due to viral RNA being missing since the amount of genomic RNA in particles from 2',5'A4-treated cultures was likewise only reduced by a factor of 2-3. Pulse-chase radioactive label experiments showed that processing of both viral group-specific antigens (gag) and viral envelope glycoprotein (env) gene products was completely normal in nucleotide-treated cultures, but that the rate of appearance of viral proteins in mature virus in the culture supernatants was reduced by a factor of about 3-4. Taken together, the data show that assembly of viral structural proteins into virions which can be released into the medium is slowed, and that assembly of virus particles with reduced infectivity follows upon nucleotide treatment. This inhibition of infectious virus production takes place without significant toxic effects on the cell; host protein synthesis is only 20% inhibited. There is also no significant effect on the secretory ability of the cells as measured by total protein release into the medium or release of fibronectin.

Elementary composition of purified mitochondria was found to correspond to about 11.5 per cent nitrogen, 1.6 per cent phosphorus, and 27 per cent lipids. Phosphorus and nitrogen content of the lipid portion suggests that as much as 75 to 80 per cent of the lipids of mitochondria is represented by phospholipids. Tests for ribose nucleic acid were positive. 3. Microsomes were separated by means of centrifugation at 18,000 x g. A relation between the high phosphorus content of the microsomes and the marked basophilia of the cytoplasm of leukemic cells is suggested. 4. Phosphorus distribution in the tumor extract, and light absorption analysis of the third fraction, seem to demonstrate that nucleic acid was not present either in a free condition, or in the form of nucleoprotein of relatively low molecular weight. The nature of the results suggests that ribose nucleic acid occurs in the cytoplasm of leukemic cells only in association with formed elements of relatively large size, namely microsomes, and mitochondria.", "pubdate_sims": "1944-07-01"}, "19871554": {"title": "FRACTIONATION OF MAMMALIAN LIVER CELLS BY DIFFERENTIAL CENTRIFUGATION : II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES AND RESULTS.", "abstract": "1. A method is described whereby the major components of liver suspensions are segregated according to size into three main fractions: (a) a large granule fraction composed of elements approximately 0.5 to 2 micro in diameter; (b) a microsome fraction composed of submicroscopic elements approximately 80 to 150 mmicro in diameter; and, (c) a supernate fraction containing the soluble components of the extract. 2. The nature and origin of the constituents of liver extract is discussed. The large granule fraction is deemed to consist mostly of mitochondria and liver secretory granules, whereas the microsome fraction corresponds to the chromophilic ground substance of the hepatic cell. Phosphorus distribution in the supernate fraction, and ultraviolet absorption of the solution suggests that practically all the ribose nucleoproteins of liver extract are sedimentable, and occur in association with the large granules and microsomes. 3. The method of fractionation of liver suspension by differential centrifugation is being used as a means to investigate the chemical constitution of the morphological constituents of cytoplasm, and the distribution of biochemical activities in the cytoplasm of the hepatic cell. 4. The method of differential centrifugation is found to be applicable not only to the fractionation of cells but also, with the aid of auxiliary techniques, to the fractionation of much smaller elements, such as mitochondria.", "pubdate_sims": "1946-06-30"}}, "sims_info": {"19871508": {"title": "STUDIES ON THE BIOCHEMICAL, BIOPHYSICAL, AND IMMUNOGENIC PROPERTIES OF JAPANESE B TYPE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS AND VACCINES.", "abstract": "Studies on the biochemical, biophysical, and immunogenic properties of Japanese B type encephalitis virus and vaccines have been made in order to determine whether a purified vaccine suitable for human use could be obtained by means of differential centrifugation of extracts of infected mouse brains. Studies were also made on extracts of normal mouse brains, it was found that extracts of normal as well as of infected mouse brains contained fairly large amounts of several components of high molecular weight. Components having sedimentation constants near 5 and 40 Svedberg units were found in extracts of infected brains. However the rates of sedimentation of the different components were so similar that it was found impossible, from a practical standpoint, to secure a vaccine consisting largely of virus by means of differential centrifugation. It was also found that a considerable portion of virus was lost or destroyed in the centrifugation process so that it was impossible to secure an effective degree of concentration of immunogenic potency. Although vaccines possessing about twice the immunogenic potency of the starting material were obtained, it was concluded that it was not practical to purify and concentrate Japanese B type encephalitis virus in infected mouse brain extracts by means of differential centrifugation for the production of a vaccine on a large scale. The optimum pH stability range of Japanese B type encephalitis virus activity was found to be near pH 8.5. The virus is inactivated fairly rapidly at pH 7 and very rapidly at more acid reactions. The virus is inactivated rapidly near pH 10. Extracts of infected mouse brains with buffers near pH 8 containing disodium phosphate were found to possess slightly higher titers than saline extracts near pH 7. However vaccines prepared from such extracts were found to possess essentially the same immunogenic potency, hence, although extraction at the more alkaline reaction may perhaps remove more active virus, there was no indication that more immunogenic material was removed at the more alkaline reaction. The use of different diluents in the titration of virus activity and the use of different agents in the preparation and storage of virus suspensions were investigated. It was found that low titers were obtained when Ringer's solution, phosphate buffer at pH 7, or saline-phosphate buffer at pH 8.2 were used as diluents but that high titers were obtained when 10 per cent rabbit serum in saline or in phosphate buffer, 10 per cent skim milk in saline or in phosphate buffer, or 1 per cent arginine at pH 8.3 were used. Undiluted skim milk adjusted to pH 8.4 was found to be as satisfactory as undiluted rabbit serum for the preparation of infected brain suspensions for storage at -70 degrees C. A satisfactory neutralization test was conducted with virus stored in undiluted skim milk at -70 degrees C. and subsequently diluted with 10 per cent skim milk in saline. The demonstration that skim milk can be substituted for rabbit serum in the storage, titration, and neutralization tests of Japanese B type encephalitis virus is of practical importance, for skim milk is more convenient to prepare and more readily available in many localities.", "pubdate_sims": "1945-11-30"}}}, "19871454": {"target_info": {"title": "a study of tissue culture cells by electron microscopy : methods and preliminary observations.", "abstract": "by means of a tissue culture technique, cells from chick embryos were procured in a state which proved to be suitable for electron microscopy. the electron micrographs disclosed details of cell structure not revealed by other methods of examination.", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1945-03-01", "references": ["16560409", "17789864", "18746197"], "similars": ["19871454", "13357524", "14085839", "7241590", "15392987", "15977171", "13664681", "7217876", "13269555", "2980704", "14799733", "11292177", "14241785", "3571960", "31136209", "11812132", "7257882", "10932320", "24510888", "14219028", "2698266", "14494194", "9648112", "14911929", "5816593", "8305729", "1175754", "575022", "16933305", "9068374", "6206642", "486120", "1096675", "32780825", "1194834", "399981", "13846469", "2740872", "1880596", "3971632", "3989451", "12471476", "567901", "4871087", "670857", "5606195", "7570590", "7020880", "7074361", "13554497", "1091352", "323035", "13242595", "95456", "558124", "6047916", "405022", "6826194", "8036234", "5519363", "8737815", "16235730", "4672729", "29167984", "14080786", "2323996", "28304763", "11702197", "22566049", "2776967", "28060338", "10986702", "6906132", "7253027", "10692126", "3802428", "6083864", "1947942", "1895029", "34266508", "21466950", "15204979", "11528622", "680579", "5715536", "3682005", "4576021", "3888398", "14757468", "31069683", "8861104", "6716488", "5764095", "5816594", "32939721", "6237527", "1702442", "1034373", "6659061"]}, "refs_info": {"16560409": {"title": "The Electron Microscope: A New Tool for Bacteriological Research.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1941-03"}, "17789864": {"title": "THE CONSTITUTION OF PROTOPLASM.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1943-05-21"}, "18746197": {"title": "The California Physicians' Service and the Low-Income Patient.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1942-05"}}, "sims_info": {}}, "13575440": {"target_info": {"title": "enzymatic o-methylation of epinephrine and other catechols.", "abstract": "", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1958-09", "references": [], "similars": ["13575440", "13575439", "13467248", "14133567", "13566227", "13555880", "14416370", "14232090", "13795313", "13663254", "844582", "13675772", "4340872", "14209612", "13281060", "13539831", "5519142", "5012775", "13298164", "13813624", "14232089", "5806102", "5370312", "13062109", "13685717", "5780981", "13612147", "14402881", "13460272", "4166083", "13602353", "13467217", "5519141", "13653770", "13611646", "13508577", "13588326", "5815398", "13585592", "14398339", "5383323", "13563353", "13353956", "13612148", "13332592", "13652357", "13510275", "6664821", "13524216", "13476031", "13561133", "14919100", "6026251", "5763055", "14387676", "6064359", "13580222", "13566204", "13365069", "5356643", "13626995", "5758867", "4387356", "3182167", "13416921", "4258612", "13469073", "13885511", "4995113", "13685718", "962125", "13836287", "13030766", "7155787", "5430406", "13327047", "14153266", "4851081", "14421549", "13795632", "13787409", "13548916", "14413247", "14433251", "13985455", "14459404", "12649306", "14254111", "13951903", "13813871", "6048864", "3654425", "14071749", "29859522", "14490259", "13835406", "14012794", "14009283", "13914211", "14148235", "14019255"]}, "refs_info": {}, "sims_info": {"13467248": {"title": "Fluorescence of ethylenediamine derivatives of epinephrine and norepinephrine.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1957-09-20"}, "13566227": {"title": "Fluorescent derivatives obtained by the reaction of ethylene diamine with epinephrine and norepinephrine.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1958-07-19"}, "13555880": {"title": "Effect of light on fluorescence of ethylenediamine derivatives of epinephrine and norepinephrine.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1958-05-30"}, "13281060": {"title": "[Elimination of catechols in hypertensive and control subjects;

The \"curares\" are shown to act by competitive inhibition at the myoneural junction, confirming earlier work of others on the mode of action of curare. 4. Atropine acts as an inhibitor at the myoneural junction. The inhibition may be non-competitive or it may be complicated by an additional effect at some point other than the myoneural junction. 5. A possible mechanism for anomalous inhibitor effects is the action of a single compound at more than one locus in the Ach mechanism. Eserine exerts such a dual effect at the end-plate. 6.

phage sulfur in a form precipitable by antiphage serum, and capable of specific adsorption to bacteria. it releases into solution nearly all the phage dna in a form not precipitable by antiserum and not adsorbable to bacteria. the sulfur-containing protein of the phage particle evidently makes up a membrane that protects the phage dna from dnase, comprises the sole or principal antigenic material, and is responsible for attachment of the virus to bacteria. 2. adsorption of t2 to heat-killed bacteria, and heating or alternate freezing and thawing of infected cells, sensitize the dna of the adsorbed phage to dnase. these treatments have little or no sensitizing effect on unadsorbed phage. neither heating nor freezing and thawing releases the phage dna from infected cells, although other cell constituents can be extracted by these methods. these facts suggest that the phage dna forms part of an organized intracellular structure throughout the period of phage growth. 3. adsorption of phage t2 to bacterial debris causes part of the phage dna to appear in solution, leaving the phage sulfur attached to the debris. another part of the phage dna, corresponding roughly to the remaining half of the dna of the inactivated phage, remains attached to the debris but can be separated from it by dnase. phage t4 behaves similarly, although the two phages can be shown to attach to different combining sites. the inactivation of phage by bacterial debris is evidently accompanied by the rupture of the viral membrane. 4. suspensions of infected cells agitated in a waring blendor release 75 per cent of the phage sulfur and only 15 per cent of the phage phosphorus to the solution as a result of the applied shearing force. the cells remain capable of yielding phage progeny. 5. the facts stated show that most of the phage sulfur remains at the cell surface and most of the phage dna enters the cell on infection. whether sulfur-free material other than dna enters the cell has not been determined. the properties of the sulfur-containing residue identify it as essentially unchanged membranes of the phage particles. all types of evidence show that the passage of phage dna into the cell occurs in non-nutrient medium under conditions in which other known steps in viral growth do not occur. 6. the phage progeny yielded by bacteria infected with phage labeled with radioactive sulfur contain less than 1 per cent of the parental radioactivity. the progeny of phage particles labeled with radioactive phosphorus contain 30 per cent or more of the parental phosphorus. 7. phage inactivated by dilute formaldehyde is capable of adsorbing to bacteria, but does not release its dna to the cell. this shows that the interaction between phage and bacterium resulting in release of the phage dna from its protective membrane depends on labile components of the phage particle. by contrast, the components of the bacterium essential to this interaction are remarkably stable. the nature of the interaction is otherwise unknown. 8. the sulfur-containing protein of resting phage particles is confined to a protective coat that is responsible for the adsorption to bacteria, and functions as an instrument for the injection of the phage dna into the cell. this protein probably has no function in the growth of intracellular phage. the dna has some function. further chemical inferences should not be drawn from the experiments presented.", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1952-05", "references": ["14850435", "14898025", "14898043", "14938301",

In the absence of the AHPF under conditions of multiple infection the amount of phage released is approximately equal to the number of infecting particles between two to ten. Over ten particles per cell has no further effect on the yield of virus. 3. The experimental evidence indicates that it is the phage particle and not some other component in the lysate which can replace the AHPF. 4. The minimum latent period and rise period of cells singly infected in the presence of the AHPF and multiply infected in the absence of the AHPF are the same. 5. The desoxynucleic acid synthesis of cells, infected with a very few virus particles in the presence of excess AHPF and multiply infected with ten particles in the absence of the AHPF, occurs at approximately the same rate, with both infected samples synthesizing about the same amount of desoxynucleic acid and liberating the same yields of virus. 6. A strain of S. muscae which requires aspartic acid for virus synthesis when singly infected does not need this substance when multiply infected, the burst size under the latter conditions depending upon the multiplicity of infection between 3 to 12 particles per cell. 7. The data indicate that the virus released from multiply infected cells in the absence of added AHPF or aspartic acid is newly synthesized virus and not the original infecting particles. 8. The phage particle contains the AHPF and aspartic acid. 9. As a tentative working hypothesis, it is assumed that the AHPF and aspartic acid for phage formation under conditions of multiple infection, in the absence of added AHPF, or of aspartic acid, are contributed by the original infecting particles. 10. Ultraviolet-inactivated phage is adsorbed to the host cell and kills the cell although little virus is released under the experimental conditions. 11. Ultraviolet-inactivated phage particles, if added before the active particle is adsorbed, will greatly inhibit the liberation of new virus particles; but does not do so if added a few minutes after the active particle has been adsorbed. 12. Under the experimental conditions, reactivation of phage when present in multiply infected cells does not occur; and such ultraviolet-inactivated phage cannot serve as a source of the AHPF or aspartic acid, although the AHPF can be liberated from such inactivated particles by acid hydrolysis. 13.

I.

This is brought about by placing the infected bacteria into the growth medium supplemented with 0.01 M cyanide and with a high titer T6 lysate. It was found in some of the later experiments that the T6 lysate is essential only during the first half of the latent period. Cyanide alone will induce lysis during the latter part of the latent period. Using this method on T4-infected bacteria it is found that during the first half of the latent period no phage particles, not even those originally infecting the bacteria, are recovered. This result is in agreement with the gradually emerging concept that a profound alteration of the infecting phage particle takes place before reproduction ensues. During the second half of the latent period mature phage is found to accumulate within the bacteria at a rate which is parallel to the approximately linear increase of intracellular DNA in this system. However, the phage production lags several minutes behind DNA production. When 5-methyltryptophan replaced cyanide as the metabolic inhibitor, similar results were obtained. The curves were, however, displaced several minutes to the left on the time axis.

The host cell synthesizes some ultraviolet-absorbing material probably devoted to building future particles. From the 7th to 9th minute the x-ray resistance of the virus particle increases, probably because of some internal change. Then, multiplication starts and is completed at about the 13th minute, when an average of 130 virulent units is present per cell, displaying an x-ray resistance twice as high as that of the extracellular virus particle. From 13 minutes to the end, the new units progressively recover the x-ray sensitivity of the extracellular virus. Nothing can be said about either the rate of multiplication between 9 and 13 minutes, or the nature of the multiplying units, except that they are more radiation-resistant (probably smaller) than the extracellular virus.

On dilution with 20 volumes of sterile medium, growth is resumed at its former rate after a short lag. In the one-step growth of T2, 15, T6, or T7, in the same medium at the same temperature, 0.4 M urethane, when added at the time of infection, had no apparent effect on adsorption and caused no decrease in titer throughout the latent period of the control, but completely prevented a rise in titer. If diluted 1:20 with sterile medium prior to a certain critical time in the latent period, however, bacteriophage was liberated at the same time, and in the same amount as in the control. The initial stage of apparent insensitivity to the drug lasts from the time of infection until the approximate critical times of 7 minutes with T7, T2, or T6, or 13 minutes with T5. Under the conditions described, the normal latent periods were 14, 23, 30, and 44 minutes for T7, T2, T6, and T5, respectively. At the critical times referred to above, there begins a stage characterized by complete sensitivity, rather than complete insensitivity, to 0.4 M urethane, in the sense that no active phage is subsequently liberated in continued presence of the drug. The length of this completely sensitive stage, as judged by addition of the drug at successive intervals during the latent period, extends from approximately 7 until 9 minutes after infection with T7, 7 until 15 minutes with T2 or T6, or 13 until 25 minutes with T5. When the urethane is added late in this stage of T2, a decrease in initial titer takes place as judged by assays made 40 minutes after infection, the maximum effect occurring when the drug is added between 14 and 15 minutes after infection. When added subsequently to the completely sensitive stage of each type, i.e. subsequently to 9 minutes after infection with T7, 15 minutes with T2 or T6, or 25 minutes with T5, liberation of the bacteriophage takes place in presence of the drug, but the yield is reduced, the amount of reduction being greater the sooner it is added. The yield increases as addition of the drug is delayed, but it is measurably reduced when added late in the rise period. Macroscopic lysis with T7 is delayed by 0.4 M urethane, when present from the time of infection. The delay is less with increased multiplicities of infection. A similar delay occurs with T6r at a multiplicity of 4. The application of hydrostatic pressures of 7,000 to 9,000 p.s.i. early in the latent period, within 5 to 8 minutes after infection, prevents a yield in each of the four phage types, and if maintained for lengthy periods of time a reduction in initial titer occurs. If released at various times shortly after the latent period, a rise in the titer occurred after a certain interval whose length was characteristic of the phage type. The yield was less the longer the release of pressure was delayed. When the pressure was first applied late in the latent period, large amounts of phage were liberated either under pressure or explosively when pressure was released to make the assays. Hydrostatic pressure at 6,000 p.s.i. had little effect on the rate or amount of macroscopic clearing with T7 in relatively high multiplicity of infection, when applied at the start of lysis, but slowed the rate and reduced the amount of clearing when applied shortly after infection.", "pubdate_sims": "1951-05"}, "14824494": {"title": "Phage formation in Staphylococcus muscae cultures.

Two of the strains when singly infected cannot release phage in Fildes' synthetic medium unless a substance present in certain acid-hydrolyzed proteins is added to the medium. One of these strains also requires other substance(s) present in acid-hydrolyzed proteins in order to grow in Fildes' medium. 3. The two strains which do not require the addition of the phage-stimulating factor have been found either to synthesize this substance, or one similar to it. One of these strains will not grow in Fildes' medium unless substance(s) present in acid-hydrolyzed proteins is added to the medium. 4. The purified acid-hydrolyzed protein factor necessary for virus liberation does not affect the multiplication rate of uninfected S. muscae cells in Fildes' synthetic medium. 5. The substance is not needed for the adsorption or the invasion of the host cell by the virus. In the absence of the factor, the virus is adsorbed to the cell and \"kills\" it. 6. An analysis carried out by means of the one-step growth curve technique has indicated that the substance is not concerned simply with the mechanism of virus release, but is necessary for some initial stage in virus synthesis. 7. With one bacterial strain not requiring the AHPF, aspartic acid had to be present at least during the minimum latent period for the cell to form virus. 8. In the absence of aspartic acid, the virus was adsorbed to the cell and killed it, but no virus was released from singly infected bacteria. 9.

The procedure consisted essentially in collecting the active agent on a reinforced collodion membrane of a porosity that would just retain all the active agent and permit extraneous material to pass through. Advantage was taken of the fact that B. coli will proliferate and regenerate bacteriophage in a completely diffusible synthetic medium with ammonia as the only source of nitrogen, which permitted the purification of the bacteriophage by copious washing. The material thus obtained was concentrated by suction and after thorough washing possessed all the activity of the original filtrate. It was labile, losing its activity in a few days on standing, and was quickly and completely inactivated upon drying. This material contained approximately 15 per cent of nitrogen and with 2 or 3 mg. samples of inactive dry residue it was possible to obtain positive protein color tests. The concentrated and purified bacteriophage has about 10(-14) mg. of nitrogen, or 6 x 10(-17) gm. of protein per unit of lytic activity. Assuming that each unit of activity represents a molecule, the calculated maximum average molecular weight would be approximately 36,000,000, and on the assumption of a spherical shape of particles and a density of 1.3, the calculated radius would be about 22 millimicra. By measurement of the diffusion rate, the average radius of particle of the fraction of the purified bacteriophage which diffuses most readily through a porous plate was found to be of the order of magnitude of 9 millimicra, or of a calculated molecular weight of 2,250,000. Furthermore, when this purified bacteriophage was fractionated by forcing it through a thin collodion membrane, which permits the passage of only the smaller particles, it was possible to demonstrate in the ultrafiltrate active particles of about 2 millimicra in radius, and of a calculated molecular weight of 25,000. It was of interest to apply this method of purification to a staphylococcus bacteriophage. Since this organism does not readily grow in synthetic medium, a diffusate of yeast extract medium was employed. The better of two preparations contained about 10(-12) mg. of nitrogen per unit of lytic activity. Although this is about one hundred times the amount of nitrogen found in an active unit of B. coli bacteriophage, nevertheless, the diffusion rate experiments gave results which paralleled those obtained with the coliphage. The diffusible particles of the crude staphylococcus bacteriophage had a radius of about 7 millimicra, and a calculated molecular weight of about 1,000,000, while the particles of the same phage which appeared in the ultrafiltrate through a thin collodion membrane had a radius of about 2.4 millimicra and a calculated molecular weight of about 45,000. It appears, therefore, that the active principle is distributed as particles of widely different sizes. However, since the smaller particles have all the properties of bacteriophage, the larger particles probably do not represent free molecules, but either are aggregates, or more likely, inactive colloids to which the active agent is adsorbed. The protein isolated, which bears the phage activity, is capable of stimulating the production of antilytic antibodies on parenteral injection into rabbits or guinea pigs. It retains its specific antigenicity when inactivated by formalin, but not when inactivated by drying.", "pubdate_sims": "1939-11-20"}, "19873108": {"title": "THE GROWTH OF BACTERIOPHAGE.", "abstract": "1.

The reaction between an antistaphlycoccal phage and the homologous bacterium has been studied, applying the following experimental technics not used in earlier work reported from this laboratory: (a) Both the activity assay and the plaque count were utilized for determining [phage]. (b) Sampling was done at short intervals; i.e., every 0.1 hour. (c) Extracellular phage was separated from the cell-bound fraction by a filtration procedure permitting passage of < 95 per cent of free phage. 2. Using these technics, the reaction was followed: (a) with pH maintained at 6.10 and temperature at 28 degrees C. to slow the process; (b) with pH maintained at 7.2 and temperature at 36 degrees C. 3. In addition separate experiments were performed on the sorption of phage by bacteria at 30 degrees , 23 degrees , and 0 degrees C. 4. At pH 6.10 and 28 degrees C. the phage-bacterium reaction proceeds in the following sequence: (a) There is an initial phase of rapid logarithmic sorption of phage to susceptible cells, during which the total phage activity and the plaque numbers in the mixtures remain constant. (b) When 90 per cent of the phage has been bound, there is a sudden very rapid increase in phage activity not paralleled by an increase in plaques; i.e., phage is formed intracellularly, but is retained within cellular confines. (c) After a further drop in the extracellular phage fraction there occurs a pronounced increase in the total phage plaque count not accompanied by any increase in total activity. This indicates a redistribution of phage formed intracellularly. At the same time there is a rise in the extracellular phage curves (both activity and plaque). (d) With the concentrations of phage and bacteria used in the experiment carried out at pH 6.1 and 28 degrees C. there are two further increments in [phage](act.) before massive lysis begins. (e) During terminal lysis there are sharp rises in the curves for [total phage](plaq.), [extracellular phage](act.), and [extracellular phage](plaq.). (f) Immediately after the completion of lysis there is a considerable disparity between measurements of total phage and extracellular phage, probably occasioned by the association of phage molecules with cellular debris, the latter being of sufficient size to be removed by the super-cel filters. 5. At pH 7.2 and 36 degrees C. the steps in the phage production curve as determined by activity assay and plaque count are much less prominent than those observed at pH 6.1 and 28 degrees C. However, the plateaus described by Ellis and Delbr\u00fcck (10) for B. coli and coli phage can be detected also in the present case if frequent samples are taken. 6. The sorption experiments show a significant rise in the rate of phage uptake with increase in temperature, again supporting the view that the reaction involves more than a purely physical adsorption. 7.

The activity assay has been demonstrated to be an accurate procedure for determining either phage free in solution or phage bound to living susceptible cells, under the conditions of the experiments reported here and in earlier work. 9.

Lysis from within is caused by infection of a bacterium by a single phage particle and multiplication of this particle up to a threshold value. The cell contents are then liberated into solution without deformation of the cell wall. 3. Lysis from without is caused by adsorption of phage above a threshold value. The cell contents are liberated by a distension and destruction of the cell wall. The adsorbed phage is not retrieved upon lysis. No new phage is formed. 4.

Liberation of phage from a culture in which the bacteria have been singly infected proceeds at a constant rate, after the lapse of a minimum latent period, until all the infected bacteria are lysed. 6.

At 1 degrees C., the attachment rate is almost equally rapid but largely reversible. If a suboptimal concentration of the necessary ions is employed when T2 virus attaches to host cells, the resulting binding is largely reversible, even at 37 degrees C. Reversible T2 attachment to host cells leaves the cell undamaged and capable of normal reproduction. Irreversible attachment results in death of the cell. Zn(++) exercises a specific inhibitory action on the invasion of E. coli B by T1 virus. The virus can still attach to the host cell at a rate closely approximating the maximum value, but the reaction remains reversible and the cell is protected against permanent damage. The protective action of the Zn against T1 invasion is exerted through an action on the cell, rather than on the virus. Studies of the uptake of radioactive Zn(65) show that cells become completely immune to T1 invasion when, on the average, 4 x 10(7) atoms of Zn have been taken up by each cell. Cells killed by ultraviolet irradiation still bind T1 at the maximum rate, but the reaction is reversible even when taking place at 37 degrees C., in optimum salt concentration. The tryptophane-deficient mutant of T4 bacteriophage requires its specific cofactor for the initial step of attachment to the host cell. These experiments support the picture previously developed that virus invasion of host cells consists in an initial, reversible attachment whose properties are those to be expected from the operation of electrostatic binding forces. The step is followed by an enzymatic transformation which is irreversible, strongly temperature-dependent, and in the case of T1 virus, susceptible to inactivation by ultraviolet radiation. The resistance of mutant cells to specific bacteriophages is of two types, depending on whether the first or second of these steps is blocked.", "pubdate_sims": "1951-09"}, "18139005": {"title": "The influence of hydrostatic pressure and urethane on the thermal inactivation of bacteriophage.", "abstract": "In Difco nutrient broth, containing 0.5 per cent NaCl, pH 6.6, Escherichia coli phages T1, T2, and T5 were inactivated at 66 degrees C., and T7 at 60 degrees C., at nearly the same rate. In each case the rate of destruction was not uniform but more or less decreased with time of heating. With T2 there was an initial increase in number of infective centers after heating for several minutes at 66 degrees C. Hydrostatic pressures up to 10,000 pounds per square inch retarded the thermal destruction of T1, T2, and T5, but accelerated that of T7, while small concentrations of urethane accelerated the rate of each. The rate of inactivation was increased by the addition of 0.005 M phosphate, and was decreased by 0.005 M MgCl(2) in all but T7, whose rate was unaffected by this amount of Mg. The influence of Ca was similar to that of Mg. The addition of 0.005 M MgCl(2) to the broth medium resulted in a first order rate of destruction of T5 at either normal or increased pressure, and with as well as without urethane. Analysis of data obtained under these conditions indicated that the thermal inactivation proceeds with a volume increase of activation of 113 cc. per mol, and with a heat and entropy of 170,000 calories and 425 E. U., respectively, in the rate-limiting reaction. In the presence of 0.1 M urethane the heat and volume change of activation are apparently slightly greater. The relation between concentration of urethane and the amount of acceleration in rate of destruction at normal pressure and 66 degrees C. indicated that the total rate involves at least two first order rate processes: the thermal inactivation itself and a urethane-catalyzed reaction, the latter involving the combination of an average of 2.3 molecules of urethane in the activated state of the bacteriophage molecule whose destruction results in loss of phage activity.", "pubdate_sims": "1949-09"}, "14898043": {"title": "The intracellular growth of bacteriophages.

Moreover, we have endeavored to ascertain the mechanism of this phenomenon and have found that in order to elicit it it is necessary to control the numbers of live and dead bacteria in the mixture. An excess of dead bacteria interferes with lysis by adsorbing the bacteriophage before it has the opportunity to initiate necessary changes in the live bacteria, so that all lysis is prevented. The phenomenon is specific, that is, the lysis of live bacteria is accompanied by lysis of dead bacteria of the same species only. Lysis of dead bacteria occurs best with staphylococcus, an organism which easily undergoes spontaneous autolysis under appropriate conditions. In the case of B. coli or B. dysenteriae the lysis of the dead bacteria is uncertain. Dead bacteria need not be present in the mixture at the beginning of the experiment; they will be dissolved if added any time before, during, or after the completion of lysis of live bacteria. If the test is performed so that a suitable semipermeable membrane is interposed between the dead and live bacteria, the dead bacteria are not dissolved, in spite of the lysis of live bacteria on the other side of the membrane. The agent determining the lysis of dead bacteria is not diffusible, while the principle initiating the lysis of live bacteria diffuses freely and is demonstrably present on both sides of the membrane. The complete independence of the agent causing dissolution of dead bacteria from bacteriophage can also be shown by separating the two agents by means of filtration, or by adsorption on bacteria. The ferment-like substance responsible for the lysis of dead bacteria is different from the bacteriophage. It is not diffusible through collodion, it is easily adsorbed on clay filters, it is heat-labile, and is inactivated on standing. An agent possessing identical properties was found in cultures of staphylococcus undergoing spontaneous autolysis in the absence of bacteriophage, but in this instance the agent appeared in the filtrates considerably later than it did when phage was present.", "pubdate_sims": "1927-04-30"}, "19873141": {"title": "INCREASE IN BACTERIOPHAGE AND GELATINASE CONCENTRATION IN CULTURES OF BACILLUS MEGATHERIUM.", "abstract": "1.

Activation proceeds best on the acid side of neutrality although variation in pH from 5 to 9 has relatively little effect.

Streaming boundaries were obtained with all dilute suspensions of particles in solutions containing no soluble protein instead of the flat ones usually observed with the Tiselius moving boundary technique. This boundary artifact was suppressed by maintaining a density gradient of sufficient magnitude in association with the moving boundary to counteract the tendency of endosmotic flow. This was done partially by increasing the concentration of the particles in the suspensions, and almost completely by retaining an excess of soluble-coating substance in the solutions containing the particles. The mobility of elementary bodies of vaccinia corresponds to that found for the heat-stable (S) antigen. This value was not altered by drying, heating, ether extraction, or simple washing, but was materially increased by treatment with the surface active detergent (duponol) which presumably altered the nature of the surface of the virus particles. Collodion particles coated with the heat-stable antigen of vaccinia had the same mobility as elementary bodies under comparable conditions. Glass particles coated with normal rabbit serum moved at the rate of albumin, the fastest serum component in the buffer solutions used. However, both collodion particles and vaccine virus moved at a somewhat slower rate when they were similarly coated and measured in the presence of an excess of serum in the solutions. This was probably due to adsorption of a small amount of one of the slower components (globulin) of rabbit serum on the surface of the particles.

(a) For live, resting, susceptible B suspended in broth as well as for B in a P-B mixture during the logarithmic phases of B growth and P formation, P is distributed in a manner typical of numerous materials soluble in both phases of a two phase system, i.e., distribution proceeds in accordance with the equation C(b)/C(a) = K where C(b) = extracellular P/ml. of broth and C(a) = intracellular P/ml. of B. The combination is quantitatively reversible. (b) With heat-killed, susceptible B, P distribution is of the adsorptive type, expressible in the form of the adsorption isotherm equation a = kC(1/n). The average value of 1/n is 0.80 in agreement with the results of von Angerer (2). Under ordinary conditions dead B take up much more P than do live B, the reaction proceeding to > 99 per cent completion. The combination of P with dead B is not demonstrably reversible and with high initial P/B ratios saturation of B with P is effected. Bacteria killed at 65 degrees C., 80 degrees C. and 100 degrees C. show no differences in adsorptive ability. (c) The rates at which live, resting, susceptible B and heat-killed, susceptible B remove P from solution do not differ significantly. Velocity constants of the process calculated from See PDF for Equation agree satisfactorily. It is shown that the time interval consumed is concerned with an actual reaction between P and B and not with diffusion of P through the broth to B. (d) P determinations have been found to serve as satisfactory indicators for B growth in P-B mixtures where [B] is to be maintained at a constant level. Very small increments in [B] give rise to measurable increases in P by virtue of the fact that dP/dt is proportional to a power of the rate dB/dt (9).

The residue remaining inside the membrane contains the bulk of the original lytic agent, and yet it is no longer capable of diffusing into the outer solution. The interruption of diffusion is shown not to be due to any alteration in the permeability of the membrane. Moreover, the residue fails to diffuse through a fresh membrane of similar permeability, while the dialyzed portion of the phage passes quantitatively through a new membrane. When ultrafiltration under pressure was substituted for dialysis, the residue on the filter could be washed repeatedly with water without giving off into the filtrate any more active agent. However, if broth was substituted for water, a renewed diffusion of the active agent resulted. These results are interpreted as indicating that the colloidal particles present in the lytic filtrates (and apparently endowed with properties of bacteriophage) do not represent autonomous units of the active agent, but merely serve as a vehicle on which the agent is adsorbed. The vary in size within limits wide enough to permit fractionation by means of ultrafiltration.

The hemolysin whose formation is induced by yeast ribonucleic acid appears to be identical with streptolysin S. 3. Desoxyribonucleic acid, products of acid or alkaline hydrolysis of ribonucleic acid, or many other substances tested, fail to produce a similar effect. 4. Digestion by ribonuclease increases markedly the streptolysin-inducing activity of certain preparations of ribonucleic acid. 5. A fraction (AF) of yeast nucleic acid has been isolated which possesses approximately 100 times the streptolysin-inducing capacity of the starting material. Some of the properties which distinguish AF, a polynucleotide, from ordinary yeast nucleic acid are described. AF is associated with the ribonuclease-resistant fraction of yeast nucleic acid. 6. Ribonucleic acid prepared from streptococci, wheat germ, and mammalian liver, and subsequently treated with ribonuclease, is about as active in causing streptolysin formation as ribonuclease-treated yeast nucleic acid. 7. Ribonucleic acid of tobacco mosaic virus, tested under comparable conditions, was found to be inactive. 8. Ribonucleic acid prepared from streptococci, wheat germ, and tobacco mosaic virus resembles yeast nucleic acid in possessing a ribonuclease-resistant fraction. 9. In addition to AF, a factor (or factors), present in meat infusion and in peptone, was found to be required for the formation of streptolysin. 10. The factor can be partially replaced by any one of several carbohydrates, the most active being maltose, glucosamine, and trehalose, in that order. 11. When appropriate concentrations of AF, maltose, and glucose are used, the nucleic acid-induced streptolysin can be produced in a medium whose chemical composition is essentially defined.", "pubdate_sims": "1948-08"}, "14192376": {"title": "GUANINE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES FROM YEAST-SOLUBLE-RIBONUCLEIC ACIDS.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1964-06-22"}, "13970457": {"title": "The nucleotide sequences adjacent to the 5'-termini of yeast soluble ribonucleic acids.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1963-02-18"}, "14861277": {"title": "On the nature of the products formed by the action of crystalline ribonuclease (Kunitz's ribonuclease) on yeast ribonucleic acid.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1951-07"}, "14153840": {"title": "THE RIBOSOMAL TRANSFER RNA: IDENTIFICATION, ISOLATION, LOCATION AND PROPERTIES.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1964-03-23"}, "15436487": {"title": "The titratable groups of ribonucleic acid from yeast and of certain fractions derived by the action of ribonuclease.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1950-07"}, "14213369": {"title": "ACTION OF SPLEEN PHOSPHODIESTERASE UPON YEAST SOLUBLE RIBONUCLEIC ACID.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1964-06"}, "14086735": {"title": "STUDIES ON SOLUBLE RIBONUCLEIC ACID: THE ACTION OF SNAKE VENOM PHOSPHODIESTERASE ON SOLUBLE RIBONUCLEIC ACID IN YEAST.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1963-12"}, "12980992": {"title": "Ribonuclease.

{"target_info": {"title": "cis-trans isomers of vitamin a and retinene in the rhodopsin system.", "abstract": "vitamin a and retinene, the carotenoid precursors of rhodopsin, occur in a variety of molecular shapes, cis-trans isomers of one another. for the synthesis of rhodopsin a specific cis isomer of vitamin a is needed. ordinary crystalline vitamin a, as also the commercial synthetic product, both primarily all-trans, are ineffective. the main site of isomer specificity is the coupling of retinene with opsin. it is this reaction that requires a specific cis isomer of retinene. the oxidation of vitamin a to retinene by the alcohol dehydrogenase-cozymase system displays only a low degree of isomer specificity. five isomers of retinene have been isolated in crystalline condition: all-trans; three apparently mono-cis forms, neoretinenes a and b and isoretinene a; and one apparently di-cis isomer, isoretinene b. neoretinenes a and b were first isolated in our laboratory, and isoretinenes a and b in the organic research laboratory of distillation products industries. each of these substances is converted to an equilibrium mixture of stereoisomers on simple exposure to light. for this reaction, light is required which retinene can absorb; i.e., blue, violet, or ultraviolet light. yellow, orange, or red light has little effect. the single geometrical isomers of retinene must therefore be protected from low wave length radiation if their isomerization is to be avoided. by incubation with opsin in the dark, the capacity of each of the retinene isomers to synthesize rhodopsin was examined. all-trans retinene and neoretinene a are inactive. neoretinene b yields rhodopsin indistinguishable from that extracted from the dark-adapted retina (lambda(max.) 500 mmicro). isoretinene a yields a similar light-sensitive pigment, isorhodopsin, the absorption spectrum of which is displaced toward shorter wave lengths (lambda(max.) 487 mmicro). isoretinene b appears to be inactive, but isomerizes preferentially to isoretinene a, which in the presence of opsin is removed to form isorhodopsin before the isomerization can go further. the synthesis of rhodopsin in solution follows the course of a bimolecular reaction, as though one molecule of neoretinene b combines with one of opsin. the synthesis of isorhodopsin displays similar kinetics. the bleaching of rhodopsin, whether by chemical means or by exposure to yellow or orange (i.e., non-isomerizing) light, yields primarily or exclusively all-trans retinene. the same appears to be true of isorhodopsin. the process of bleaching is therefore intrinsically irreversible. the all-trans retinene which results must be isomerized to active configurations before rhodopsin or isorhodopsin can be regenerated. a cycle of isomerization is therefore an integral part of the rhodopsin system. the all-trans retinene which emerges from the bleaching of rhodopsin must be isomerized to neoretinene b before it can go back; or if first reduced to all-trans vitamin a, this must be isomerized to neovitamin ab before it can regenerate rhodopsin. the retina obtains new supplies of the neo-b isomer: (a) by the isomerization of all-trans retinene in the eye by blue or violet light; (b) by exchanging all-trans vitamin a for new neovitamin ab from the blood circulation; and (c) the eye tissues may contain enzymes which catalyze the isomerization of retinene and vitamin a in situ. when the all-trans retinene which results from bleaching rhodopsin in orange or yellow light is exposed to blue or violet light, its isomerization is accompanied by a fall in extinction and a shift of absorption spectrum about 5 mmicro toward shorter wave lengths. this is a second photochemical step in the bleaching of rhodopsin. it converts the inactive, all-trans isomer of retinene into a mixture of isomers, from which mixtures of rhodopsin and isorhodopsin can be regenerated. isorhodopsin, however, is an artefact. there is no evidence that it occurs in the retina; nor has isovitamin aa or b yet been identified in vivo. in rhodopsin and isorhodopsin, the prosthetic groups appear to retain the cis configurations characteristic of their retinene precursors. in accord with this view, the beta-bands in the absorption spectra of both pigments appear to be cis peaks. the conversion to the all-trans configuration occurs during the process of bleaching. the possibility is discussed that rhodopsin may represent a halochromic complex of a retinyl ion with opsin. the increased resonance associated with the ionic state of retinene might then be responsible both for the color of rhodopsin and for the tendency of retinene to assume the all-trans configuration on its release from the complex. a distinction must be made between the immediate precursor of rhodopsin, neovitamin ab, and the vitamin a which must be fed in order that rhodopsin be synthesized in vivo. since vitamin a isomerizes in the body, it is probable that any geometrical isomer can fulfill all the nutritional needs for this vitamin.", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1952-11", "references": ["14881069", "14885021",

Recent chemical studies have indicated that in this process the aldehyde group of retinene(1) is reduced to the primary alcohol group of vitamin A(1) (Morton; Wald). Some time ago we brought this reaction into a cell-free brei prepared from cattle retinas. The retinas were frozen, desiccated, ground, and exhaustively extracted with petroleum ether; the resulting powder, stirred in neutral buffer solution and exposed to light, converted its retinene(1) completely to vitamin A(1). Some time ago also we observed that fresh rhodopsin solutions exhibit a special type of fading in darkness following exposure to light, which is absent from the same solutions after aging. We have confirmed Bliss's identification of this reaction as the conversion of retinene(1) to vitamin A(1). The system which reduces retinene(1) is fractionated anatomically in the retinal rods. The outer segments of the rods, broken off from the underlying retinal tissue, are unable to convert their retinene(1) to vitamin A(1). In the presence of a water extract of crushed retina they do perform this conversion. On the other hand the retinal tissue from which a water extract was taken has lost this capacity.

The activating effect of retinal washings on isolated outer limbs or washed retina is duplicated by a boiled muscle juice. This in turn can be replaced by reduced cozymase (reduced coenzyme I; DPN-H(2)); or by a mixture of DPN and fructosediphosphate. The conversion of retinene(1) to vitamin A(1) is therefore a reduction in which two atoms of hydrogen are transferred to retinene(1) from reduced cozymase. It is assumed that this reaction is catalyzed by an apoenzyme, retinene(1) reductase, present in the rod outer limb. This process is coupled with a second system in the outer segment which reduces DPN, using hexosediphosphate or one of its derivatives as hydrogen donor. This action of DPN brings a member of the vitamin B complex, nicotinic acid amide, into an auxiliary position in the rhodopsin system. In the isolated retina or in vitro systems the reduction of retinene(1) proceeds irreversibly.

Seeing-frequency functions (psi[S]) determined uniocularly for small (1.6'), brief images at the thoroughly dark-adapted human central fovea take the form of log-Gaussian integrals, for intensity or for exposure-time as the independent variable. They cannot be of Poisson type, since mean (tau') and standard deviation (sigma) are quite independently modifiable. 2. The properties of tau', the abscissa of inflection in the log-Gaussian integrals, and of sigma, are discussed in relation to customary determinations of spectral visibilities; agreements and certain necessary divergences are considered. 3. The values of sigma(logDeltaIlogDeltaI0), are distributed periodically, with 5 maxima in the range lambda383 to lambda712. Outside the fovea this is not the case. These maxima, and the intervening minima, are definitely correlated with \"irregularities\" in the values of tau' as function of lambda, with data on color threshold intensities, with data on \"saturation,\" and quite specifically with minima and maxima in the data of lambda discrimination. They are unmistakably of analytical significance. 4. The interpretation of these properties is taken to require (consistent with the indications of other evidence) that under specified conditions the magnitude of sigma is a measure of the \"size\" of the population of excitable elements of neural effect, in the range of 0 to 100 per cent response-frequency as a function of wave number. This means that under the procedure used there is detectable the spectral distribution of local, specific, photosensitization. The sigma's refer to a property of the excitation process which is not affected by the action of irrelevant absorbers. 5. A preliminary test of this has been made by the use of mixed \"monochromatic\" lights. The total energy is empirically the significant quantity, although the separate effects of lambda's are sharply exhibited. 6. The lambda distribution of photosensitization indices, sigma(logDeltaIlogDeltaI0), is necessarily taken to have the nature of \"action spectra.\" Careful search discloses, surprisingly enough, precise and apparently unique correspondence with the maxima and minima (and details of shape) required for the participation of: cytochrome-c reductase; the reduced forms of cytochromes-a and -c; and the often overlooked ferric-prophyrin bands of oxidized cytochrome-c. 7. For the central fovea, in which blood vessels are absent, and in which resistance to anoxia is at a maximum, the presence of an enzyme system of the sort here indicated is entirely reasonable. It is pointed out that a number of specific experiments can be based upon the general finding, whatever the causal mechanism for the sensitized lambda regions may in the end prove to be.

Earlier work had shown that when white light is used the bleaching rate does not depend on temperature, and so must be independent of the internal energy of the molecule. On the other hand thermal bleaching in the dark has a high temperature dependence from which one can calculate that the reaction has an apparent activation energy of 44 kg. cal. per mole. It has now been shown that the bleaching rate of rhodopsin becomes temperature-dependent in red light, indicating that light and heat cooperate in activating the molecule. Apparently thermal energy is needed for bleaching at long wave lengths where the quanta are not sufficiently energy-rich to bring about bleaching by themselves. The temperature dependence appears at 590 mmicro. This is the longest wave length at which bleaching by light proceeds without thermal activation, and corresponds to a quantum energy of 48.5 kg. cal. per mole. This value of the minimum energy to bleach rhodopsin by light alone is in agreement with the activation energy of thermal bleaching in the dark. At wave lengths between 590 and 750 mmicro, the longest wave length at which the bleaching rate was fast enough to study, the sum of the quantum energy and of the activation energy calculated from the temperature coefficients remains between 44 and 48.5 kg. cal. This result shows that in red light the energy deficit of the quanta can be made up by a contribution of thermal energy from the internal degrees of freedom of the rhodopsin molecule. The absorption spectrum of rhodopsin, which is not markedly temperature-dependent at shorter wave lengths, also becomes temperature-dependent in red light of wave lengths longer than about 570 to 590 mmicro. The temperature dependence of the bleaching rate is at least partly accounted for by the temperature coefficient of absorption. There is some evidence that the temperature coefficient of bleaching is somewhat greater than the temperature coefficient of absorption at wave lengths longer than 590 mmicro;. This means that the thermal energy of the molecule is a more critical factor in bleaching than in absorption. It shows that some of the molecules which absorb energy-deficient quanta of red light are unable to supply the thermal component of the activation energy needed for bleaching, so bringing about a fall in the quantum efficiency. The experiments show that there is a gradual transition between the activation of rhodopsin by light and the activation by internal energy. It is suggested that energy can move freely between the prosthetic group and the protein moiety of the molecule. In this way a part of the large amount of energy in the internal degrees of freedom of rhodopsin could become available to assist in thermal activation. Assuming that the minimum energy required for bleaching is 48.5 kg. cal., an equation familiar in the study of unimolecular reaction has been used to estimate the number of internal degrees of freedom, n, involved in supplying the thermal component of the activation energy when rhodopsin is bleached in red light. It was found that n increases from 2 at 590 mmicro to a minimum value of 15 at 750 mmicro. One wonders what value n has at 1050 mmicro, where vision still persists, and where rhodopsin molecules may supply some 16 kg. cal. of thermal energy per mole in order to make up for the energy deficit of the quanta.", "pubdate_sims": "1952-01"}, "14913164": {"title": "Cis-trans isomers of vitamin A and retinene in vision.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952-01-18"}, "14955620": {"title": "The role of sulfhydryl groups in the bleaching and synthesis of rhodopsin.", "abstract": "The condensation of retinene(1) with opsin to form rhodopsin is optimal at pH about 6, a pH which favors the condensation of retinene(1) with sulfhydryl rather than with amino groups.

The latter is known to be the precursor of vitamin A(1) in the rhodopsin cycle of the retinal rods. The synthetic product is here referred to as \"retinene(1).\" In the present experiments this observation is confirmed. The procedure is recast in the form of a chromatographic oxidation. Manganese dioxide is packed in a column, vitamin A(1) solution poured in at the top, and the product drawn off in the filtrate. Depending upon the proportions of manganese dioxide and vitamin A(1), the product is either \"retinene(1),\" or a new substance which yields with antimony chloride a wine-red product with maximal absorption at 545 mmicro (545 mmicro chromogen). This procedure is an example of a potentially important class of chromatographic reactions. The synthetic \"retinene(1)\" is virtually identical with the natural substance in absorption spectrum and antimony chloride reaction.

An extreme and rapid degeneration which occurred in tissue cultures of leucocytes from the blood of cats, guinea pigs, and rabbits, is described in detail. 2. This degeneration was found to appear in the culture when the cells were planted in any of the culture media tried, some of which were autogenous heparin plasma, autogenous plasma, autogenous serum, Tyrode solution, and mixtures of these with embryo juice. 3. The specific cellular changes which occurred are described for the different leucocytes. In general, there was first a latent period during which no change could be observed in the cell. Following this there was a period of stimulation during which the motion of the cell was greatly accelerated. This second stage has been observed in all cells except the lymphocyte, in which it may possibly occur to a slight degree. Finally there was the terminal stage, the stage of degeneration, in which the cell rounded up, lost its motility, and either became badly swollen or else underwent a more or less complete coagulation. 4. The factor causing this degeneration was found to be exposure of the culture to light, as, for example, during microscopic examination. 5. By a reduction of the infrared part of the spectrum, it was indicated that the effect was not due to a heat coagulation of the cells. 6. This degeneration was also found to occur in the complete absence of ultra-violet wave-lengths. 7. Further, it was shown that this degeneration was caused by light which lay within each of the three wave-length zones (1) 430micromicro to 550micromicro; infra-red; (2) 475micromicro to 630micromicro; 690micromicro to infra-red; (3) 600micromicro to infra-red. 8. No indication was given as to whether all regions of these zones were active in causing the degeneration, or whether the active rays are limited to certain wave-length bands lying within these zones. 9. This degeneration of the leucocytes under the action of light was also found to occur upon irradiation of hanging drops of whole blood. This is interpreted as showing conclusively that the degeneration was not dependent upon the additional factors of centrifugation, continued lowering of temperature, or the presence of abnormal saline solution. 10. It was noted, however, that the leucocytes in hanging drop cultures required a markedly longer time for their degeneration under the action of light than did the leucocytes in cultures prepared from the buffy coat and inoculated in serum. This is considered as possibly due, either to injury to the cell during centrifugation and subsequent handling, or to some action of the red blood cells present in large amounts in the hanging drops of whole blood. 11. In these hanging drop cultures of whole blood degeneration of the leucocytes was also found to occur when the light reaching the culture was first freed from the larger part of its infra-red and from all of its ultra-violet. 12.

The similarity between the curves for bacteria, virus, and phage, both in shape and in total involved energies, suggests the presence of a common factor, or of closely related chemical entities, sensitive to ultra-violet light, whereas the data for the tumor agent suggest that its inactivation is due to the destruction of a substance having an essentially different spectral absorption, and therefore of a different chemical character. While the amount of ultra-violet energy required to affect the tumor agent is great, it is still less than that involved in the inactivation of some of the enzymes (7).

After a discussion of the sources of error involved in the study of dark adaptation, an apparatus and a procedure are described which avoid these errors. The method includes a control of the initial light adaptation, a record of the exact beginning of dark adaptation, and an accurate means of measuring the threshold of the fovea after different intervals in the dark. 2. The results show that dark adaptation of the eye as measured by foveal vision proceeds at a very precipitous rate during the first few seconds, that most of the adaptation takes place during the first 30 seconds, and that the process practically ceases after 10 minutes. These findings explain much of the irregularity of the older data. 3. The changes which correspond to those in the fovea alone are secured by correcting the above results in terms of the movements of the pupil during dark adaptation. 4. On the assumption that the photochemical effect of the light is a linear function of the intensity, it is shown that the dark adaptation of the fovea itself follows the course of a bimolecular reaction. This is interpreted to mean that there are two photolytic products in the fovea; that they are disappearing because they are recombining to form anew the photosensitive substance of the fovea; and that the concentration of these products of photolysis in the sense cell must be increased by a definite fraction in order to produce a visual effect. 5. It is then suggested that the basis of the initial event in foveal light perception is some mechanism that involves a reversible photochemical reaction of which the \"dark\" reaction is bimolecular.

In presence of these dyes inhibition of luminescence, which without the dye occurs only in blue-violet light, takes place in green, yellow, orange, or red light, depending on the position of the absorption bands of the dye. 2. Inhibition of Cypridina luminescence without photosensitive dye in blue-violet light, or with photosensitive dye in longer wave-lengths, does not occur in absence of oxygen. Light acts by accelerating the oxidation of luciferin without luminescence. Eosin or methylene blue act by making longer wave-lengths effective, but there is no evidence that these dyes become reduced in the process. 3. The luciferin-oxyluciferin system is similar to the methylene white-methylene blue system in many ways but not exactly similar in respect to photochemical change. Oxidation of the dye is favored in acid solution, reduction in alkaline solution. However, oxidation of luciferin is favored in all pH ranges from 4 to 10 but is much more rapid in alkaline solution, either in light or darkness.

Data are presented for the dark adaptation of four species of animals. They show that during dark adaptation the reaction time of an animal to light of constant intensity decreases at first rapidly, then slowly, until it reaches a constant minimum. 2. On the assumption that at all stages of adaptation a given response to light involves a constant photochemical effect, it is possible to describe the progress of dark adaptation by the equation of a bimolecular reaction. This supposes, therefore, that dark adaptation represents the accumulation within the sense cells of a photosensitive material formed by the chemical combination of two other substances. 3. The chemical nature of the process is further borne out by the fact that the speed of dark adaptation is affected by the temperature. The velocity constant of the bimolecular process describing dark adaptation bears in Mya a relation to the temperature such that the Arrhenius equation expresses it with considerable exactness when micro = 17,400. 4. A chemical mechanism is suggested which can account not only for the data of dark adaptation here presented, but for many other properties of the photosensory process which have already been investigated in these animals. This assumes the existence of a coupled photochemical reaction of which the secondary, \"dark\" reaction is catalyzed by the products of the primary photochemical reaction proper.

Like cytochrome c the pigment of yeast extracts appears to be distinct from the ordinary hemochromogen of blood, because of the difference in position of the bands of the native materials and of the corresponding pyridine hemochromogens. On treatment with acetic acid, however, the yeast extract yields alpha-hematin, as identified spectroscopically. It is evident then that one portion of its iron-porphyrin nucleus is identical with alpha-hematin (iron-protoporphyrin), which must be present not as such, but in chemical combination. The alkaline extracts of C. diphtheriae, compared with those of The alkaline extracts of C. diphtheriae, compared with those of B. phosphorescens and yeast, show a constant difference in the position of the two bands in the green, which lie nearer the red end of the spectrum, at mmicro 556 and 528. This extract likewise on treatment with acetic acid yields alpha-hematin, which in the form of its alkaline hemochromogen may be responsible for the bands in the alkaline extract at mmicro 556 and 528. Great interest has attached in our investigation to the substance responsible for the absorption band in the alkaline extracts about 575. Extraction with acetic acid-ether of these alkaline solutions, as well as of the whole bacteria, yields a material which shows absorption bands at mmicro 575-574 and 539-535, and appears to be identical with a complex porphyrin which has been found in culture filtrates of C. diphtheriae. This complex porphyrin has been described in a previous paper (1). It is labile and breaks down readily to yield coproporphyrin and the copper compound of coproporphyrin, and is apparently the source of the coproporphyrin which is often found free in the culture filtrates. In the work repeated earlier we had been unable to obtain this complex porphyrin, or porphyrin compound, directly from the bacteria. In the present work we have been successful in obtaining it from the three species investigated. The behavior of the complex porphyrin extracted from the whole bacteria is the same as of that found in filtrates. It is insoluble in 25 per cent HCl, and on disintegration gives coproporphyrin and the copper compound of coproporphyrin. Information is quite lacking as to the particular form of combination in which this complex porphyrin occurs within the cell. The complex porphyrin is certainly not present there in the form in which it appears in the extracts. If diphtheria bacilli showing strong absorption bands of reduced cytochrome, while under examination with the microspectroscope are treated with glacial acetic acid, the bands of cytochrome are seen to fade and are replaced by those of the complex porphyrin at mmicro 575 and 539. The origin of the copper which is found, combined with coproporphyrin, as a product of the disintegration of the porphyrin compound, has been a matter of uncertainty. In the case of filtrates of C. diphtheriae it has seemed possible that the copper was never a constituent of the bacteria, and that combination with copper occurs only after the porphyrin has been liberated from the bacterial cell. With washed bacteria, however, the presence of copper in extracts indicates that this element has been taken up from the culture medium and incorporated within the cell. Whether or not the copper is there combined with porphyrin cannot be decided by the present evidence. Copper occurs naturally, however, in combination with porphyrin in turacin (14), a pigment of the wing feathers of certain birds. In the present case such combination seems the more probable, so that the complex porphyrin may represent a form in which copper is contained within the cell. Objection may be raised to the use of the term complex porphyrin or porphyrin compound for the substance referred to here and in the previous paper (1). The name hemochromogen might be applied with equal justification. Until the chemical nature of the substance is better known, however, it seems best not to use any but a simple descriptive name. Reference should not be omitted here to the bacteriological significance of this compound, which arises from the correlation which we have previously observed between its amount and the content of toxin, in filtrates of C. diphtheriae. In respect to this porphyrin compound the pathogen C. diphtheriae seems to differ from the nonpathogenic forms in the readiness with which the material is liberated from the bacteria in cultures, rather than in the nature of the material.", "pubdate_sims": "1932-07-20"}, "19872826": {"title": "RESULTS OF IRRADIATING SACCHAROMYCES WITH MONOCHROMATIC ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT : I.

The eye tissues of all permanently marine fishes examined, except the tautog, contain vitamin A(1) alone. Those of all permanently freshwater fishes possess only vitamin A(2). Those of all euryhaline (potentially migratory) fishes, except possibly the alewife, contain mixtures of both vitamins A, and always predominantly that one which ordinarily is associated with the environment in which the fish is spawned. These correlations extend in part to the liver oils, but most livers contain mixtures of both vitamins A, and occasionally in proportions the reverse of those in the eye tissues. The vitamin A configuration does not depend upon environmental circumstances, but is determined genetically.

The accumulation of visual purple in the retina after bleaching by light has been studied in the intact eye of the frog.

At 25 degrees C. frogs which have been light adapted to 1700 millilamberts and then placed in the dark, show an increase in visual purple concentration which begins immediately and continues for 70 minutes until a maximum concentration is attained. The increase, although beginning at once, is slow at first, then proceeds rapidly, and finally slows up towards the end. Frogs which have been adapted to 9500 millilamberts show essentially the same phenomenon except that the initial slow period is strongly delayed so that almost no visual purple is formed in the first 10 minutes. 3. At 15 degrees C. the initial delay in visual purple regeneration occurs following light adaptation to both 1700 and 9500 millilamberts. The delay is about 10 minutes and is slightly longer following the higher light adaptation. 4. The entire course of visual purple accumulation in the dark takes longer at the lower temperature than at the higher. The temperature coefficient for 10 degrees C. is about 1.8. 5. In contrast to the behavior of the isolated retina which has small amounts of vitamin A and large amounts of retinene immediately after exposure to light, the intact eye has large amounts of vitamin A and little retinene after exposure to light for 10 minutes. In the intact eye during dark adaptation, the amount of vitamin A decreases markedly while retinene decreases only slightly in amount. If retinene is formed in the intact eye, the change from retinene to vitamin A must therefore occur rapidly in contrast to the slow change in the isolated retina. 6.

Although the carotenoid pigments are present in large concentration in the plastids of etiolated Avena seedlings as compared with protochlorophyll, the pigment precursor of chlorophyll, it is possible to show that the carotenoids do not act as filters of the light incident on the plant in the blue region of the spectrum where they absorb heavily. This suggests that the carotenoids are located behind the protochlorophyll molecules in the plastids. 2. Since the carotenoids do not screen and light is necessary for chlorophyll formation, an effectiveness spectrum of protochlorophyll can be obtained which is the reciprocal of the light energy necessary to produce a constant amount of chlorophyll with different wavelengths. The relative effectiveness of sixteen spectral regions in forming chlorophyll was determined. 3. From the effectiveness spectrum, one can conclude that protochlorophyll is a blue-green pigment with major peaks of absorption at 445 mmicro, and 645 mmicro, and with smaller peaks at 575 and 545 mmicro. The blue peak is sharp, narrow, and high, the red peak being broader and shorter. This differs from previous findings where the use of rougher methods indicated that red light was more effective than blue and did not give the position of the peaks of absorption or their relative heights. 4. The protochlorophyll curve is similar to but not identical with chlorophyll. The ratio of the peaks of absorption in the blue as compared to the red is very similar to chlorophyll a, but the position of the peaks resembles chlorophyll b. 5.

Manganese dioxide is packed in a column, vitamin A(1) solution poured in at the top, and the product drawn off in the filtrate.

The synthesis of rhodopsin, though unaffected by the less powerful sulfhydryl reagents, monoiodoacetic acid and its amide, is inhibited completely by p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). This inhibition is reversed in part by the addition of glutathione. PCMB does not attack rhodopsin itself, nor does it react with retinene(1). Its action in this system is confined to the -SH groups of opsin. Under some conditions the synthesis of rhodopsin is aided by the presence of such a sulfhydryl compound as glutathione, which helps to keep the -SH groups of opsin free and reduced. By means of the amperometric silver titration of Kolthoff and Harris, it is shown that sulfhydryl groups are liberated in the bleaching of rhodopsin, two such groups for each retinene(1) molecule that appears. This is true equally of rhodopsin from the retinas of cattle, frogs) and squid. The exposure of new sulfhydryl groups adds an important element to the growing evidence that relates the bleaching of rhodopsin to protein denaturation. The place of sulfhydryl groups in the structure of rhodopsin is still uncertain. They may be concerned directly in binding the chromophore to opsin; or alternatively they may furnish hydrogen atoms for some reductive change by which the chromophore is formed from retinene(1). In the amperometric silver titration, the bleaching of rhodopsin yields directly an electrical variation. This phenomenon may have some fundamental connection with the role of rhodopsin in visual excitation, and may provide a model of the excitation process in general.", "pubdate_sims": "1952-05"}, "13011282": {"title": "Cis-trans isomers of vitamin A and retinene in the rhodopsin system.", "abstract": "Vitamin A and retinene, the carotenoid precursors of rhodopsin, occur in a variety of molecular shapes, cis-trans isomers of one another. For the synthesis of rhodopsin a specific cis isomer of vitamin A is needed. Ordinary crystalline vitamin A, as also the commercial synthetic product, both primarily all-trans, are ineffective. The main site of isomer specificity is the coupling of retinene with opsin. It is this reaction that requires a specific cis isomer of retinene. The oxidation of vitamin A to retinene by the alcohol dehydrogenase-cozymase system displays only a low degree of isomer specificity. Five isomers of retinene have been isolated in crystalline condition: all-trans; three apparently mono-cis forms, neoretinenes a and b and isoretinene a; and one apparently di-cis isomer, isoretinene b. Neoretinenes a and b were first isolated in our laboratory, and isoretinenes a and b in the Organic Research Laboratory of Distillation Products Industries. Each of these substances is converted to an equilibrium mixture of stereoisomers on simple exposure to light. For this reaction, light is required which retinene can absorb; i.e., blue, violet, or ultraviolet light. Yellow, orange, or red light has little effect. The single geometrical isomers of retinene must therefore be protected from low wave length radiation if their isomerization is to be avoided. By incubation with opsin in the dark, the capacity of each of the retinene isomers to synthesize rhodopsin was examined. All-trans retinene and neoretinene a are inactive. Neoretinene b yields rhodopsin indistinguishable from that extracted from the dark-adapted retina (lambda(max.) 500 mmicro). Isoretinene a yields a similar light-sensitive pigment, isorhodopsin, the absorption spectrum of which is displaced toward shorter wave lengths (lambda(max.) 487 mmicro). Isoretinene b appears to be inactive, but isomerizes preferentially to isoretinene a, which in the presence of opsin is removed to form isorhodopsin before the isomerization can go further. The synthesis of rhodopsin in solution follows the course of a bimolecular reaction, as though one molecule of neoretinene b combines with one of opsin. The synthesis of isorhodopsin displays similar kinetics. The bleaching of rhodopsin, whether by chemical means or by exposure to yellow or orange (i.e., non-isomerizing) light, yields primarily or exclusively all-trans retinene. The same appears to be true of isorhodopsin. The process of bleaching is therefore intrinsically irreversible. The all-trans retinene which results must be isomerized to active configurations before rhodopsin or isorhodopsin can be regenerated. A cycle of isomerization is therefore an integral part of the rhodopsin system. The all-trans retinene which emerges from the bleaching of rhodopsin must be isomerized to neoretinene b before it can go back; or if first reduced to all-trans vitamin A, this must be isomerized to neovitamin Ab before it can regenerate rhodopsin. The retina obtains new supplies of the neo-b isomer: (a) by the isomerization of all-trans retinene in the eye by blue or violet light; (b) by exchanging all-trans vitamin A for new neovitamin Ab from the blood circulation; and (c) the eye tissues may contain enzymes which catalyze the isomerization of retinene and vitamin A in situ. When the all-trans retinene which results from bleaching rhodopsin in orange or yellow light is exposed to blue or violet light, its isomerization is accompanied by a fall in extinction and a shift of absorption spectrum about 5 mmicro toward shorter wave lengths. This is a second photochemical step in the bleaching of rhodopsin. It converts the inactive, all-trans isomer of retinene into a mixture of isomers, from which mixtures of rhodopsin and isorhodopsin can be regenerated. Isorhodopsin, however, is an artefact. There is no evidence that it occurs in the retina; nor has isovitamin Aa or b yet been identified in vivo. In rhodopsin and isorhodopsin, the prosthetic groups appear to retain the cis configurations characteristic of their retinene precursors. In accord with this view, the beta-bands in the absorption spectra of both pigments appear to be cis peaks. The conversion to the all-trans configuration occurs during the process of bleaching. The possibility is discussed that rhodopsin may represent a halochromic complex of a retinyl ion with opsin. The increased resonance associated with the ionic state of retinene might then be responsible both for the color of rhodopsin and for the tendency of retinene to assume the all-trans configuration on its release from the complex.

The various isomers have been extensively interconverted by gentle procedures, and all of them have been converted to all-trans retinene. The present theory of cis-trans isomerism in carotenoids predicts the existence of four stable isomers of retinene. Instead we seem to have five-specifically three mono-cis forms where two are expected. There is no doubt that all these substances are closely related isomers of one another. The only point in question is whether they differ in part by something other than cis-trans configuration. One possibility, as yet little supported by evidence, is that isomerization between beta- and alpha-ionone rings may be involved.

The synthesis of rhodopsin, though unaffected by the less powerful sulfhydryl reagents, monoiodoacetic acid and its amide, is inhibited completely by p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). This inhibition is reversed in part by the addition of glutathione. PCMB does not attack rhodopsin itself, nor does it react with retinene(1). Its action in this system is confined to the -SH groups of opsin. Under some conditions the synthesis of rhodopsin is aided by the presence of such a sulfhydryl compound as glutathione, which helps to keep the -SH groups of opsin free and reduced. By means of the amperometric silver titration of Kolthoff and Harris, it is shown that sulfhydryl groups are liberated in the bleaching of rhodopsin, two such groups for each retinene(1) molecule that appears. This is true equally of rhodopsin from the retinas of cattle, frogs) and squid. The exposure of new sulfhydryl groups adds an important element to the growing evidence that relates the bleaching of rhodopsin to protein denaturation. The place of sulfhydryl groups in the structure of rhodopsin is still uncertain. They may be concerned directly in binding the chromophore to opsin; or alternatively they may furnish hydrogen atoms for some reductive change by which the chromophore is formed from retinene(1). In the amperometric silver titration, the bleaching of rhodopsin yields directly an electrical variation. This phenomenon may have some fundamental connection with the role of rhodopsin in visual excitation, and may provide a model of the excitation process in general.", "pubdate_sims": "1952-05"}, "13011282": {"title": "Cis-trans isomers of vitamin A and retinene in the rhodopsin system.", "abstract": "Vitamin A and retinene, the carotenoid precursors of rhodopsin, occur in a variety of molecular shapes, cis-trans isomers of one another. For the synthesis of rhodopsin a specific cis isomer of vitamin A is needed. Ordinary crystalline vitamin A, as also the commercial synthetic product, both primarily all-trans, are ineffective. The main site of isomer specificity is the coupling of retinene with opsin. It is this reaction that requires a specific cis isomer of retinene. The oxidation of vitamin A to retinene by the alcohol dehydrogenase-cozymase system displays only a low degree of isomer specificity. Five isomers of retinene have been isolated in crystalline condition: all-trans; three apparently mono-cis forms, neoretinenes a and b and isoretinene a; and one apparently di-cis isomer, isoretinene b. Neoretinenes a and b were first isolated in our laboratory, and isoretinenes a and b in the Organic Research Laboratory of Distillation Products Industries. Each of these substances is converted to an equilibrium mixture of stereoisomers on simple exposure to light. For this reaction, light is required which retinene can absorb; i.e., blue, violet, or ultraviolet light. Yellow, orange, or red light has little effect. The single geometrical isomers of retinene must therefore be protected from low wave length radiation if their isomerization is to be avoided. By incubation with opsin in the dark, the capacity of each of the retinene isomers to synthesize rhodopsin was examined. All-trans retinene and neoretinene a are inactive. Neoretinene b yields rhodopsin indistinguishable from that extracted from the dark-adapted retina (lambda(max.) 500 mmicro). Isoretinene a yields a similar light-sensitive pigment, isorhodopsin, the absorption spectrum of which is displaced toward shorter wave lengths (lambda(max.) 487 mmicro). Isoretinene b appears to be inactive, but isomerizes preferentially to isoretinene a, which in the presence of opsin is removed to form isorhodopsin before the isomerization can go further. The synthesis of rhodopsin in solution follows the course of a bimolecular reaction, as though one molecule of neoretinene b combines with one of opsin. The synthesis of isorhodopsin displays similar kinetics. The bleaching of rhodopsin, whether by chemical means or by exposure to yellow or orange (i.e., non-isomerizing) light, yields primarily or exclusively all-trans retinene. The same appears to be true of isorhodopsin. The process of bleaching is therefore intrinsically irreversible. The all-trans retinene which results must be isomerized to active configurations before rhodopsin or isorhodopsin can be regenerated. A cycle of isomerization is therefore an integral part of the rhodopsin system. The all-trans retinene which emerges from the bleaching of rhodopsin must be isomerized to neoretinene b before it can go back; or if first reduced to all-trans vitamin A, this must be isomerized to neovitamin Ab before it can regenerate rhodopsin. The retina obtains new supplies of the neo-b isomer: (a) by the isomerization of all-trans retinene in the eye by blue or violet light; (b) by exchanging all-trans vitamin A for new neovitamin Ab from the blood circulation; and (c) the eye tissues may contain enzymes which catalyze the isomerization of retinene and vitamin A in situ. When the all-trans retinene which results from bleaching rhodopsin in orange or yellow light is exposed to blue or violet light, its isomerization is accompanied by a fall in extinction and a shift of absorption spectrum about 5 mmicro toward shorter wave lengths. This is a second photochemical step in the bleaching of rhodopsin. It converts the inactive, all-trans isomer of retinene into a mixture of isomers, from which mixtures of rhodopsin and isorhodopsin can be regenerated. Isorhodopsin, however, is an artefact. There is no evidence that it occurs in the retina; nor has isovitamin Aa or b yet been identified in vivo. In rhodopsin and isorhodopsin, the prosthetic groups appear to retain the cis configurations characteristic of their retinene precursors. In accord with this view, the beta-bands in the absorption spectra of both pigments appear to be cis peaks. The conversion to the all-trans configuration occurs during the process of bleaching. The possibility is discussed that rhodopsin may represent a halochromic complex of a retinyl ion with opsin. The increased resonance associated with the ionic state of retinene might then be responsible both for the color of rhodopsin and for the tendency of retinene to assume the all-trans configuration on its release from the complex. A distinction must be made between the immediate precursor of rhodopsin, neovitamin Ab, and the vitamin A which must be fed in order that rhodopsin be synthesized in vivo. Since vitamin A isomerizes in the body, it is probable that any geometrical isomer can fulfill all the nutritional needs for this vitamin.", "pubdate_sims": "1952-11"}, "18108501": {"title": "The reduction of retinene1 to vitamina A1 in vitro.", "abstract": "In the surviving vertebrate retina the retinene(1) liberated by bleaching rhodopsin is converted quantitatively to vitamin A(1). Recent chemical studies have indicated that in this process the aldehyde group of retinene(1) is reduced to the primary alcohol group of vitamin A(1) (Morton; Wald). Some time ago we brought this reaction into a cell-free brei prepared from cattle retinas. The retinas were frozen, desiccated, ground, and exhaustively extracted with petroleum ether; the resulting powder, stirred in neutral buffer solution and exposed to light, converted its retinene(1) completely to vitamin A(1). Some time ago also we observed that fresh rhodopsin solutions exhibit a special type of fading in darkness following exposure to light, which is absent from the same solutions after aging. We have confirmed Bliss's identification of this reaction as the conversion of retinene(1) to vitamin A(1). The system which reduces retinene(1) is fractionated anatomically in the retinal rods. The outer segments of the rods, broken off from the underlying retinal tissue, are unable to convert their retinene(1) to vitamin A(1). In the presence of a water extract of crushed retina they do perform this conversion. On the other hand the retinal tissue from which a water extract was taken has lost this capacity. Such washed retinal tissue is reactivated by returning the washings to the solid material. The activating effect of retinal washings on isolated outer limbs or washed retina is duplicated by a boiled muscle juice. This in turn can be replaced by reduced cozymase (reduced coenzyme I; DPN-H(2)); or by a mixture of DPN and fructosediphosphate. The conversion of retinene(1) to vitamin A(1) is therefore a reduction in which two atoms of hydrogen are transferred to retinene(1) from reduced cozymase. It is assumed that this reaction is catalyzed by an apoenzyme, retinene(1) reductase, present in the rod outer limb. This process is coupled with a second system in the outer segment which reduces DPN, using hexosediphosphate or one of its derivatives as hydrogen donor. This action of DPN brings a member of the vitamin B complex, nicotinic acid amide, into an auxiliary position in the rhodopsin system. In the isolated retina or in vitro systems the reduction of retinene(1) proceeds irreversibly. Yet this reduction must be balanced by an oxidative process elsewhere in the rhodopsin cycle, since through rhodopsin as intermediate vitamin A(1) regenerates retinene(1).", "pubdate_sims": "1949-01"}, "18870869": {"title": "The synthesis from vitamin A1 of retinene 1 and of a new 545 m-mu chromogen yielding light-sensitive products.", "abstract": "Ball, Goodwin, and Morton (1946) have reported that vitamin A(1) in contact with solid manganese dioxide is transformed slowly into a substance which displays spectroscopic properties of retinene(1). The latter is known to be the precursor of vitamin A(1) in the rhodopsin cycle of the retinal rods. The synthetic product is here referred to as \"retinene(1).\" In the present experiments this observation is confirmed. The procedure is recast in the form of a chromatographic oxidation. Manganese dioxide is packed in a column, vitamin A(1) solution poured in at the top, and the product drawn off in the filtrate. Depending upon the proportions of manganese dioxide and vitamin A(1), the product is either \"retinene(1),\" or a new substance which yields with antimony chloride a wine-red product with maximal absorption at 545 mmicro (545 mmicro chromogen). This procedure is an example of a potentially important class of chromatographic reactions. The synthetic \"retinene(1)\" is virtually identical with the natural substance in absorption spectrum and antimony chloride reaction. It lacks the pH indicator properties of crude natural retinene(1). The 545 mmicro chromogen possesses absorption maxima at 380 and 290 mmicro in chloroform; at 376 and 290 mmicro in ethanol; and at 361 and 277 mmicro in hexane. It is non-fluorescent. It has no acidic character, but on the contrary is mildly basic, being extracted from hexane by sulfuric or hydrochloric acids to form orange-red products. In partition between petroleum ether and aqueous methanol it is highly hypophasic. It is adsorbed strongly on calcium carbonate. Certain peculiarities in spectral behavior indicate the presence of a carbonyl group in the 545 mmicro chromogen, and support Morton's proposal that such a group occurs in retinene(1). Other properties of the 545 mmicro chromogen indicate hydroxyl groups. This substance therefore appears to be a hydroxy-carbonyl derivative of vitamin A(1). The red products which the 545 mmicro chromogen forms with antimony chloride or with sulfuric or hydrochloric acids are all markedly light-sensitive.

Market-bought fowls of similar variety have shown themselves insusceptible, as have fowls of mixed breed, pigeons and guinea-pigs. The percentage of successful transplantations has been small, but in the individuals developing a tumor its growth has been fairly rapid. Young chickens are more susceptible than adults. The reinoculation of negative fowls has never resulted in a growth. Throughout, the sarcoma has remained true to type. It is infiltrative and destructive. Metastasis has been observed once (to the heart). Experiments to determine whether the growth may be transmitted by cell-fragments have not yet been made. Repeated bacteriological examinations have yielded negative results. In its general behavior, so far as tested, this avian tumor closely resembles the typical mammalian neoplasms that are transplantable.", "pubdate_sims": "1910-09-01"}, "4286357": {"title": "New Jersey \"Chicken trial\": verdict for science.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1966-04-22"}, "19867522": {"title": "THE HISTOLOGICAL SIGNS OF RESISTANCE TO A TRANSMISSIBLE SARCOMA OF THE FOWL.", "abstract": "1. The living tissue of the chicken sarcoma, when implanted in susceptible hosts, survives, proliferates, and thus gives rise apparently to the whole of the new tumor. The histological findings about the graft do not suggest any other origin for the growth. 2. In fowls with a natural or acquired resistance, a very striking series of phenomena takes place about the graft or the established growth. They are referable to the presence of the living neoplastic cells and are essentially similar to those already described in mammals. 3. The lymphocyte has an association with the processes of resistance in the fowl, similar to, but more marked than that observed in mammals. 4. Resistance of the host does not constitute for the chicken tumor a differential means whereby the extrinsic agent present in the growth can be observed to engender it. In general, it may be stated that, when the new host is so unfavorable to the transplanted sarcoma cells as to cause their death, no tumor develops. 5. The activity of the extrinsic agent is negligible as affecting the interpretation of the phenomena about grafts of the avian sarcoma in resistant and susceptible hosts. They are referable to the presence of the transplanted cells. 6. The appearance or non-appearance of a specific, supporting, and vascularizing reaction in the host tissues cannot be looked upon as determining the fate of grafts of the chicken sarcoma.

Potential changes are recorded therefrom only as current flows. During the period of the after-potentials current flows in significant density only if the after-polarization differs at different points of the active neurons. Thus one does not record after-potentials in volume; one may record after-currents which are defined as the resultants of differences in after-potentials. Measurable excitability change during the period of the after-potentials, in the event no current flows, might be regarded as approximating the change of intrinsic polarization status at the region tested. In the presence of after-current flow excitability change would approximate the sum of intrinsic change and extrinsic change due to current flow. In giving rise by differences to current flow after-potentials come to act as agents, and events in one part of a neuron help to determine excitability in other parts. Since the intramedullary after-current flow is not the after-potential of the soma, it follows that ventral root electrotonus which results from axonal after-current flow cannot be considered the counterpart of somatic after-potential. Following conduction of an antidromic volley after-current flows between somata and axons. According to the signs of the recorded potential changes, after-current flow initially, and for approximately 45 msec., is in the direction from somata to axons. Thereafter, and for approximately another 75 msec., the direction of flow is reversed. During the period of after-current flow following antidromic conduction the excitability of neighboring motoneurons is altered in a manner that reproduces the phases of after-current flow. The initial phase, depression, was first described by Renshaw. The after-potentials of ventral root fibers have been studied. In a single action and in usual form, they consist of a negative after-potential of considerable magnitude and of some 35 msec. duration, and a positive after-potential detectable for approximately 120 msec. Variants and the influence of temperature change are described. The recovery cycle of ventral root axons in general compares with the after-potential cycle. Recovery of intramedullary motor axons differs from that of their extramedullary projections as ventral root fibers in a manner that is accountable to intramedullary flow of after-current. Since the intrinsic recovery process of the motoneuron somata cannot be measured in the presence of current flow it must be estimated by correcting the observed recovery for the influence of known current flows. When this is done the resultant in simplest form provides for intrinsic somatic recovery from refractoriness through a single phase of subnormality lasting some 60 msec. Conditions for the relatively undistorted recording of antidromic ventral root electrotonus are described. They include provisions that the proximal ventral root electrode must be within 12 mm. of the root-cord junction and that the distal electrode must be located in excess of 30 mm. from the distal severed end of the ventral root. Antidromic ventral root electrotonus is a counterpart of the current flows in the intramedullary stretch of the axons. Initially, during the phase of metadromal postivity of the intramedullary axons, electrotonus is negative. During the period of deflections Sp-An, that signify after-current flow into the axons, electrotonus is positive. Finally during the period of deflections Sn-Ap, that signify after-current flow outwards through the intramedullary axon membranes, electrotonus is negative. Electrotonic showing is not of sufficient magnitude to make the time course of ventral root electrotonus palpably different from that of the generating intramedullary currents.", "pubdate_sims": "1951-11"}, "15420394": {"title": "The responses of motoneurones.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1950"}}}, "12991237": {"target_info": {"title": "a quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.", "abstract": "", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1952-08", "references": ["14946713", "14861789", "16995189", "15394322", "14946714", "14946715", "14861788", "14946712"], "similars": ["12991237", "28361793", "1886055", "9120582", "7153913", "3631589", "2066126", "901899", "9782164", "4647244", "12715118", "9504390", "5828505", "7420094", "17524765", "850137", "6310095", "7509856", "17208176", "15473193", "19295243", "16956988", "6962064", "13999080", "16200764", "21918293", "5793330", "9448571", "7174896", "1271055", "28450535", "3794778", "191567", "5723515", "690876", "3500303", "5676183", "4806290", "1263120", "3194587", "6881581", "168358", "12627320", "28130923", "1432075", "521937", "30225348", "17200886", "13252238", "9448570", "28405806", "9698311", "3076013", "13295549", "14334005", "2537496"]}, "refs_info": {"14946713": {"title": "Currents carried by sodium and potassium ions through the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952-04"}, "14861789": {"title": "The sodium and potassium content of cephalopod nerve fibers.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1951-06"}, "16995189": {"title": "Correlation of local excitability with local physiological response in the giant axon of the squid (loligo).", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1940-03-14"}, "15394322": {"title": "The effect of temperature on the electrical activity of the giant axon of the squid.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1949-08"}, "14946714": {"title": "The components of membrane conductance in the giant axon of Loligo.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952-04"}, "14946715": {"title": "The dual effect of membrane potential on sodium conductance in the giant axon of Loligo.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952-04"}, "14861788": {"title": "The ionic movements during nervous activity.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1951-06"}, "14946712": {"title": "Measurement of current-voltage relations in the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1952-04"}}, "sims_info": {}}, "13054693": {"target_info": {"title": "molecular structure of deoxypentose nucleic acids.", "abstract": "", "full_text_parsed": [], "pubdate": "1953-04-25", "references": [], "similars": ["13054693", "13502693", "18917690", "18917689", "13168977", "18917691", "13111175", "7625689", "13239687", "14791329", "14858299", "14882288", "14886343", "13244640", "14838906", "13355469", "13154376", "13208684", "13208704", "13717751", "13717752", "13346340", "13694169", "13717750", "13483536", "14423092", "12569936", "13054692", "14206233", "11125100", "7583642", "16569198", "25594585", "17001733", "17268860", "17061309", "13584351", "19637175", "21432950", "21404424", "13979174", "22911172", "25236334", "7691090", "22180030", "19856354", "21049099", "15884792", "16847855", "22210334", "15911414", "12799423", "22004054", "23606566", "12688301", "17611144", "25606980", "23937264", "17406625", "19424980", "16213732", "19722507", "20963776", "25288464", "23468228", "10322207", "27861723", "17406626", "16786087", "14185582", "22915274", "20567794", "16554150", "13036888", "14860147", "14861276"]}, "refs_info": {}, "sims_info": {"18917690": {"title": "Deoxypentose nucleic acids;

Introduction", "The discovery of the double-helical structure almost 70 years ago [1] is universally recognized as one of the pivotal points in the history of science. Since then, the DNA molecule has shown us its preeminent role in life, bridging the molecular level (i.e., the DNA and its protein products) with the system level of the cell and entire organism [2]. Most surprisingly, this task is accomplished through a simple four-letters code and one base-pair rule that provides DNA with a unique molecular feature\u2014namely, self-recognition. In other words, the DNA carries in its structure the information for its own self-assembly, such that, given one strand, the complementary strand needed to form the double helix is uniquely defined. In the early 1980s, Ned Seeman recognized the tremendous implications of such a simple property for construction purposes and demonstrated how single-stranded DNA sequences can be programmed to associate into ordered molecular objects in a fully predictable fashion [3]. This led to the foundations of a new field of science, later known as structural DNA nanotechnology [4]. A notable breakthrough in the field occurred in 2006, when Paul Rothemund published a new method for folding DNA, called scaffolded DNA origami [5]. Despite relying on the same Watson-Crick base pairing rule, the DNA origami technique uses a long single-stranded DNA chain for the formation of the target shape and, by doing so, efficiently reduces the probability for spurious structures to form (we will see this process more in detail later). The consequence of this new building principle has been a dramatic improvement in our ability to engineer DNA nanomaterials, enabling us to gain access to structures with a level of sophistication previously unimaginable [6,7]. This, together with the availability of user-friendly design tools and the synthetic availability of oligonucleotides at relatively low costs, prompted the introduction of DNA nanotechnology into about 400 laboratories around the world and transformed a DNA-based building strategy into one of the methods of choice for controlling matter distribution with sub-nanometer precision [8,9,10]."], ["1. Introduction", "Structural DNA nanotechnology relies on precise design rules. Thus, a deep understanding of the relationship between the topology of the DNA molecule and its mechano-elastic and thermal properties is necessary to construct objects that are more sophisticated than a canonical double helix. Not surprisingly, the pioneer of the field is a crystallographer, and his initial works on DNA branched motifs can be best appreciated and understood only if viewed in terms of DNA topology and related energetic stability. Fortunately, modern computer-aided programs have facilitated the accessibility of DNA design approaches to nonexperts; nevertheless, any effort devoted to the improvement of current strategies or the creation of new ones necessarily requires awareness of the underlying theoretical frameworks."], ["1. Introduction", "Our purpose, in this review, is to give an overview of such theoretical background. We will therefore report in some detail the structural and energetic properties of DNA nanostructures and present the current hypotheses and models of the mechanisms that regulate their self-assembly. We will start by describing the DNA duplex (Section 2) and will move to the basic building block of all DNA nanostructures\u2014namely, the Holliday Junction (HJ), also called four-arm junction (Section 3). We will survey both the structural and energetic properties of this fundamental motif and summarize the final view that has been acquired through numerous thermodynamic and kinetic studies, both in bulk and at the single-molecule level. In Section 4, we will briefly review more complex DNA branched motifs, thus laying the ground for a better understanding of the self-assembly approach originally developed by Seeman, later called the multi-stranded (or tile-based) approach. We will then focus on the other main design school, i.e., the scaffold-based (or DNA origami) approach, and briefly discuss the structural and thermal properties of such objects (Section 5). Finally, in Section 6, we will present and critically compare both design strategies and discuss their analogy to the nucleation-and-growth mechanism of crystal formation. We will conclude by reporting recent examples of alternative approaches for guiding DNA self-assembly. In such methods, structural stability and dynamic reconfiguration properties are cleverly combined to enable the system to read information from the external environment and respond to a change, thus adapting to a new condition. These strategies, although still in their infancy, pave the way to a completely new paradigm of DNA self-assembly that\u2014by mimicking nature\u2014allows the system to undergo selection and, in this sense, to evolve."], ["2. The Double Helix", "A single-stranded DNA is a polynucleotide chain consisting of the nitrogen-containing nucleobases adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C), covalently linked to one another through a sugar-phosphate backbone. In its most common B-form, the DNA molecule is composed of two such strands oriented in an antiparallel fashion and wrapped together into a right-handed double helix, which is about 2-nm-wide and has a helical pitch of 3.4 nm every 10.5 base pairs (bp) (Figure 1). Two main forces are responsible for formation of the double helix: (i) stacking among the aromatic rings of adjacent nucleobases along each strand and (ii) hydrogen bonding between the bases of opposite strands. Whereas the former mostly contributes to the stabilization of the structure, the latter is what drives the self-recognition process according to the Watson-Crick complementarity rule (A/T and G/C). Base pairing is therefore the feature that makes the DNA molecule an ideal semanto-morphic material, i.e., a material that holds the information (semantic) for building its own structure (morphology). Most artificial DNA nanostructures, from the immobile Holliday junction to GDa-sized DNA origami multimers and DNA bricks, are based on the association of DNA oligonucleotides into double helical segments and loops intertwined with one another in various ways. The use of alternative double helical forms (such as Z-DNA) has been limited to few examples, most likely due to the requirement of non-physiological conditions such as reduced water activity or the presence of metal-ion complexes [11,12]. Other DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes, i-motifs, hairpin dumbbells or loops, have been instead typically used as chemical sensors or topological markers. "], ["2. The Double Helix", "When considering the self-assembly of a DNA based object, the most fundamental process, we have to deal with is the formation of a DNA duplex. The hybridization of two complementary strands into a full duplex has been investigated for several decades, and, although we have a thorough understanding of much of this process, some aspects still remain unsolved (for a comprehensive review on nuclei acid hybridization reactions, see reference [13]). On the basis of merely thermodynamic arguments, the annealing process is typically described as a two-state or an all-or-none model, i.e., as an equilibrium between the completely dissociated form (the two separated strands) and the fully associated form (the duplex). The nearest-neighbor model [14] can be applied to calculate the free-energy change and equilibrium constant of the association/dissociation reaction, and computational tools have been developed to estimate the rate coefficients for both the forward and reverse step [15,16]. Thus, in principle, we hold all necessary knowledge to describe and predict the outcome of a DNA duplex once the sequences of the interacting strands are given. This simplification greatly helps in the analysis and interpretation of experimental data but is inadequate to explain the strong deviations from ideality that have been observed in more complex systems. For example, as recently reported by Wales and coauthors [17], a six-nucleotide-long sequence might present a level of complexity that cannot be easily recapitulated by a two-state model and requires the introduction of sequence-specific parameters, such as modulators of DNA-hybridization mechanisms [18]. The general picture is that of a global downhill process that starts with the formation of a critical nucleation seed of few base pairs and proceeds with the propagation of the remaining base pairing interactions according to a zippering or slithering mechanism [19]. The path to the target state might be, however, rather \u201cfrustrated\u201d, meaning that the profile of the free-energy landscape presents significant hills and valleys that may cause metastable intermediates to become kinetically trapped. Thus, despite the fact that the native Watson-Crick duplex is often the conformational state corresponding to the absolute minimum of energy, local minima can be significantly populated in some cases."], ["2. The Double Helix", "The probability of visiting those metastable states, i.e., the kinetic route travelled by the system, is strongly dictated by the sequence content and length of the interacting strands and by the experimental conditions used. For example, dissociation rate coefficients may span more than eight orders of magnitude when going from a 10-mer to a 20-mer [20], whereas GG tracts have been found to hybridize much more rapidly than GC tracts of the same length [17]. This fact indicates that, in addition to the total GC content, the order of nucleobases along the sequence (i.e., the entropic contribution to the system) may greatly affect the thermodynamic stability of competing conformational ensembles and, thus, determine the preferred hybridization pathway. The energy landscape of DNA duplex formation can be also shaped by the presence of metal ions in solution, whose differential affinity towards the phosphate or nucleobases of the double helix essentially affects the capability of the complementary strands to approach and mutually interact [21]. Typically, Mg(II) ions are used in the form of chloride or acetate salts for the preparation of DNA self-assembly buffers. The high affinity of magnesium ions for the phosphate backbone of the DNA is supposed to provide sufficient Debye screening to enable the winding of DNA chains into compact structures, with bending and torsional stiffness dependent on salt concentration [22]. Thus, although the DNA duplex can be considered a well-known reference structure for most of our nanotechnological applications, with predictable thermodynamic and kinetic properties, it is worth noting that, when analyzed in detail, even this familiar system may still present unusual and peculiar features. "], ["3. The Four-Arm Junction", "To enable the growing of a DNA nanostructure beyond a simple duplex, single-stranded stretches must be shared among at least two distinct helices, thus leading to formation of DNA branched motifs [23]. Inspired by the naturally occurring Holliday junction, a key intermediate in many types of genetic recombination and double-strand break repair mechanisms, Seeman created the first immobile four-arm junction (called J1), which signed the beginning of structural DNA nanotechnology [3]. The four-arm junction is the fundamental building block of all DNA nanostructures (Figure 2a). A full comprehension of its structural and energetic properties is therefore essential to analyze the behavior of more complex assemblies and understand their mechanism of formation. In the following, we will survey the structural features of the four-arm junction and describe how these are affected by the base sequence of its component strands and the way they are connected. We will then discuss the thermodynamic properties of four-arm junctions and the kinetics of post-assembly isomerization, which, together, summarize our current view of the energy landscape that describes the folding of this motif and its conformational transition between two distinct states. "], ["3.1. Sequence-Dependent Properties of Four-Arm Junctions", "The naturally occurring Holliday junction forms when two homologous double-stranded (ds) DNA molecules exchange their strands at a common branch point [24,25]. The main feature of this natural motif is therefore the sequence symmetry of its component strands, which causes the branch point to migrate. Although this feature is essential for the successful accomplishment of the biological function, it is of course deleterious for most construction purposes. A nonmigrating branch point can be achieved by minimizing the sequence symmetry of the system. The junction becomes thus immobile, in the sense that its topological isomerization into alternative motifs is prevented. An immobile four-arm junction can nevertheless assume four possible conformations, linked through the open form of the motif (Figure 2a). In the stacked conformations, the relative orientation of the two intersected helical domains is either parallel or antiparallel, and, for each of these orientations, either one or the other of the two possible tetrads of nucleobases at the crossover is involved in stacking interactions (Figure 2a). Antiparallel isomers are largely favored with respect to their parallel analogs, restricting the number of realistically attainable structures to two. On the other hand, which of the two antiparallel stacked isoforms (referred to as iso I and iso II) will preferentially form in solution is largely dependent on the sequence of the nucleobases at the crossover and in its direct vicinity in a way that remains still unclear. After the first J1 junction from Seeman, other four-way motifs have been realized and analyzed for their conformational preference and stability. The wealth of data obtained and the different schemes used to represent the structures called for a systematic classification of synthetic HJs. Altona et al. [26] proposed a set of graphical and base priority rules for the unambiguous representation of DNA junctions. The application of these rules to a four-arm junction leads to a final scheme in which the open form is drawn with the 5\u2019 terminus of strand 1 at the bottom left side of the motif, and the remaining strands are placed in a clockwise fashion terminating with the 3\u2032 end of strand 4 on the bottom right side of the structure (Figure 2b). Accordingly, the four helical portions of the junction (indicated as I, II, III and IV) can fold either in the I/IV + II/III or I/II + III/IV coaxial stacking conformer (corresponding to the iso I and iso II species, respectively; see Figure 2a). This classification resulted in a total of 70 four-arm junctions with a unique crossover sequence (36 of which are immobile), further divided into six classes, depending on the quartet of permutated purine/pyrimidine bases at the center of the motif. According to this nomenclature, junction J1 is classified as J3-10 and displays the unique sequence TCAG at the crossover (Figure 2b). Gel electrophoresis analysis [27] and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments [28] suggested that the J1 motif is mostly in the iso I conformation. A different junction, initially called J2 and characterized by the central sequence CGTA (classified as J4-2), displays instead an inverted order of stability of the two conformers with a strong preference for iso II. On the other hand, junction J5-4 (CTTG) shows no preference at all."], ["3.2. Topology-Dependent Properties of Four-Arm Junctions", "As mentioned above, DNA junctions are composed of multiple strands with each strand participating in (at least) two different double helices. Relatively early, Seeman and coworkers realized that junctions are only one member of a larger class of double-helical multi-stranded molecules, which include antijunctions and mesojunctions [29]. Accordingly, a four-strand complex may fold into a (canonical) junction, an antijunction or one of two types of mesojunctions (Figure 2c, left panel). A convenient way to distinguish these molecules relies on drawing the four helices as straight lines so that they flank a central square (Figure 2c, right panel). The orientation of each strand is indicated by an arrowhead at the 3\u2032 end, while the helical axes are depicted as segments that cut the angle between two strands of opposite polarity. In the conventional four-arm junction, the four axes are pointing radially and meet in the center of the square. This motif is indicated as 44, where the first digit indicates the number of strands composing the motif and the subscript designates the number of helices that are radial. When, instead, all helical domains meet outside the square, i.e., their directions are circumferential rather than radial; the resulting motif is termed an antijunction and is indicated as 40. Two additional motifs can be created, in which a pair of radial helical axes and a pair of tangential helical axes coexist; however, they are either alternatively or adjacently arranged. These motifs, termed mesojunctions, are respectively indicated as 142 and 242. Of all four possible four-arm branched motifs, the conventional 44 junction shows the highest stability [29] and is, therefore, the most suitable building block for the construction of extended DNA architectures. "], ["3.3. Thermal Stability and Isomerization of Four-Arm Junctions", "Several studies have been performed to characterize the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of synthetic analogs of the Holliday junction, leading to a detailed view of the energy landscape that describes the self-assembly process of the motif (i.e., its thermally driven folding/unfolding) and its post-assembly structural reconfiguration (i.e., the iso I/iso II isomerization) (Figure 2d). Initial investigations on the thermal stability of four-way junctions were performed early after the development of the first immobile motif [30]. In their work, Marky et al. applied UV spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry to determine the enthalpy of transition of the J1 motif in a model-dependent and model-independent fashion. These values were then compared with the enthalpy of transition associated to the individual duplex arms to evaluate the impact of the central connection on the relative stability of the entire motif. The data show that each individual arm, as well as the J1 junction, exhibits a two-state melting behavior and that the enthalpy of formation for the full motif (ca. 190 kcal/mol) is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of the single arms (each one is about 48 kcal/mol). This implies that the geometry at the crossroads of the junction does not lead to disruption of enthalpically favorable interactions and, in fact, has been shown to preserve the conformation of the isolated duplex arms. Importantly, this conclusion does not mean that the formation of the junction has no enthalpic cost (as explained below, it is instead the result of positive and negative contributions that compensate each other). Several structural studies, particularly from Lilley\u2019s group [28,31], have contributed to solving the in-solution structure of the four-way junction in different environmental conditions, portraying the full energy landscape for folding and post-assembly reconfiguration of this motif. Applying a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), they determined the relative distances between the ends of the junction and, therefore, the path of the strands, revealing a right-handed antiparallel X-shaped structure. Global comparison of the FRET efficiencies obtained by labeling many identical DNA molecules at different terminal positions allowed to individuate the isomeric form assumed by a defined set of sequences and how this conformation varied in the presence of added metal ions. The results show that the transition from the low-salt extended form to the stacked X-structure occurs in a continuous noncooperative manner as the concentration of the ion (Na+, Mg2+ or Ca2+) increases. The role played by the cations is thus to supply a high local density of highly mobile positive charges that screen the negative charges around the phosphates, eventually allowing the compact junction to form. Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that, in divalent electrolytes, Mg2+ ions act as a bridge between two minor grooves of aligned DNA molecules, with an attractive force of up to 42 pN per one turn of a DNA helix [32]. The final view is therefore the following: the free energy for folding a four-way junction is largely determined by two opposite contributions: favorable helix-to-helix stacking and unfavorable electrostatic interactions at the crossing point of the helices. Whereas the former interactions determine the isomeric form of the structure (in a way that remains unclear), the latter are reduced by the presence of cations, which are then crucial to the stable assembly of the motif."], ["3.3. Thermal Stability and Isomerization of Four-Arm Junctions", "Besides the thermal stability, the kinetics of iso I to iso II isomerization has also been a matter of intense investigation. However, conventional kinetic studies in bulk solution do not permit the full characterization of the conformational transition, due to the inability to synchronize the junction into a single conformer. This challenge was successfully overcome by Ha and coworkers, as they employed single-molecule FRET to detect the conformational transition of two individual junctions, one heavily biased towards the stacking conformer iso II (with a central sequence CGTA, classified as J4-2) and the other with nearly equal populations of each conformational state (central sequence CCGG, classified as J3-4) [33]. The data reveal that the transition rates between the two conformers are sequence-dependent (with rate coefficients about 10 s\u22121 at a 1 pN applied load) and significantly decrease with an increased magnesium concentration while maintaining a 1:1 ratio. This implies that (i) magnesium ions directly affect the energy barrier between the two conformers but not their relative stability and (ii) that the open structure, which is stable in the absence of magnesium ions, is a necessary transient species (Figure 2d). Later on, the same group applied single-molecule force measurements to identify the extent of the molecular forces involved in the conformational transition, finding values in the order of 1 pN [34]. The final result was the full mapping of the energy landscape and the identification of the transition state structures that enable the passage from the open form to one of the two stacked isomers. "], ["4. The Multi-Stranded Approach", "Four-arm junctions are not the only branched DNA molecules that have been realized and explored. Applying a strict principle of sequence-symmetry minimization [35,36], three-arm, as well as five-, six- and twelve-arm junctions [37,38,39], have been constructed and characterized. According to this principle, the sequences participating in the formation of the motif are chosen to be maximally different one from the other in order to minimize the competitive formation of alternative structures. The next level of sophistication entails the use of such branched DNA molecules for the construction of geometrical objects, where the edges are double-helical stretches and the vertexes are branch points (Figure 3a). This can be achieved by prolonging the arms of the junctions with single-stranded sticky ends in order to direct the self-assembly of the tile units into stick figures, such as a quadrilateral [40] or a cube [41] or large periodic arrays [42]. A sticky end is a short stretch of single-stranded DNA that extends from the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of a double-helical region and allows for the hybridization to a complementary sticky end from a distinct duplex. Unfortunately, the structures resulting from cohesion of branched junctions are rather flexible and, therefore, cannot function as true crystals. This problem was solved with the introduction of more complex and structurally constrained tiles formed by merging multiple branch junctions together, as discussed in detail below."], ["4.1. Multi-Branched DNA Tiles", "Typical multi-branched DNA motifs are double crossovers (DX) [43,44], triple crossovers (TX) [45], DNA parallelograms [46] and four-by-four structures (also called four-point stars) [47]. Such constructs are characterized by multiple branch points connected into larger and stiffer tiles. The smallest member of this class is the DX tile [43], which is composed of two double-helical domains that cross each other in two points (Figure 3b). Five isomers of the DX molecule can be distinguished (DAE, DAO, DPE, DPOW and DPON) on the basis of the relative orientation of the helical domains (Antiparallel or Parallel), as well as the number of half-helical turns (Even or Odd) that separates the two crossovers of the tile and the insertion of the last of an odd number of half-turns into a major (Wider) or minor (Narrow) groove. All DX tiles, however, share a common feature\u2014that is, a linear geometry with two pairs of sticky ends pointing in one direction and two pairs of sticky ends pointing in the opposite direction of the same motif. The system therefore assembles with double sticky-ended intermolecular interactions instead of single sticky ends, thus making the connections more rigid and less susceptible to individual variations [48]. "], ["4.1. Multi-Branched DNA Tiles", "An interesting aspect of multi-branched tiles is their symmetry (both in terms of sequence and topology) and how this affects the outcome of the assembly process. Typically, a multi-branched DNA tile is composed of a distinct number (i) of arms, with each arm equal to a four-way junction. As the arms originate from a central branching point and are oriented radially, the motifs are referred to as i-point stars. A DX tile could be in principle viewed as a two-point star, with two four-arm junctions pointing in opposite directions. To illustrate the symmetry aspect of a multi-branched motif, it is more convenient to consider the three-point star, though the same reasoning applies also to tiles of higher order. The three-point star has been employed as the building unit of several DNA objects following one of two possible design strategies. These strategies differ in the sequence symmetry of the tile\u2014that is, in the number of distinct oligonucleotides used for its assembly (Figure 3c). In a first \u201casymmetric\u201d approach, directly derived by the sequence-symmetry minimization principle proposed by Seeman, each arm of the tile is a distinct four-arm junction [52]. Merging three such arms into the star motif results in a total of seven distinct strands: one long central strand, three lateral strands of medium length and three short strands (Figure 3c, left panel). In a second \u201csymmetric\u201d approach, initially developed by Mao [49,53,54], the same topology is achieved by using only three distinct sequences resulting from a three-fold repetition of the same four-arm junction (Figure 3c, middle panel). Thus, despite the fact that the two objects display the same geometry and can grow along three directions, the self-assembly of the asymmetric motif can be controlled at the level of each single arm-to-arm linkage, whereas the degeneracy of the symmetric tile will result in the statistically equivalent (and, therefore, indistinguishable) linkages along each of the three directions. Sequence symmetry and shape symmetry of the final assembly product are therefore not related by a one-to-one correspondence. Indeed, whereas a tile that is symmetric in terms of sequence necessarily leads to a geometrically symmetric object, the opposite is not necessarily true, meaning that a structure that is symmetric in shape (i.e., has an i-fold symmetry) does not need to be symmetric in the sequence of its component strands."], ["4.2. Structural Properties of Multi-Stranded Nanostructures", "The initial vision and final goal of structural DNA nanotechnology is to construct molecular architectures of desired geometrical features. Thus, once suitable junctions are realized, the next step is to connect them into networks. As mentioned above, this is done mostly through double sticky-end cohesion and consists in the hybridization of complementary single-stranded segments protruding from the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 termini of distinct junctions\u2019 arms. The base sequences of the sticky ends essentially define the connectivity between tiles, i.e., how tiles are linked to one another in the final object. On the other hand, the final geometry of the self-assembled product is encoded in two additional features of the system: (i) the angles between the arms of each tile and (ii) the distance between the joined crossovers of two adjacent tiles. The angles at the center of a multi-branched tile are normally defined by the length of the thymine loops inserted between adjacent arms and by the total number of arms among which the mechanical stress of the motif is distributed. For example, inserting three thymine bases between two adjacent arms of a three-point star leads to a motif with a C3 rotational symmetry, which, upon self-assembly, tiles the plane into a regular hexagonal pattern (Figure 3c, right panel). Such a tiling is also referred to as 6.6.6, indicating that, at each junction, three hexagons meet at their vertices, tiling the plane into three identical angles of 120\u00b0 [49,55]. By lowering the sequence symmetry of the system, distinct Archimedean tilings can be obtained [52]. Starting, for example, from the same three-point star, the number of thymine loops at the center of the motif can be varied such to result into one angle of 90\u00b0 and two angles of 135\u00b0. Such a motif will tile the plane into regular squares and octagons in a 4.8.8 pattern. Similarly, using a four-by-four tile, regular square-like patterns (4.4.4.4) or 3.6.3.6 tessellations can be achieved."], ["4.2. Structural Properties of Multi-Stranded Nanostructures", "One should also consider that the torsional stress at the center of a multi-branched tile gives rise to dihedral rather than planar angles, thus causing the tile to bend. Such an intrinsic curvature is of fundamental importance for the final architecture of the self-assembly product. Indeed, completely different geometries can be obtained depending on the other parameter of the tile-to-tile association, i.e., the distance between the crossovers of two adjacent tiles. Considering n as the number of half-helical turns between joined crossovers, an even multiple of half-helical turns (2n) will result in accumulation of the intrinsic curvature of the tile and formation of a closed 3D assembly [54]. On the contrary, cohesion of adjacent tiles through an odd multiple of half-helical turns (2n + 1) will cause them to face up and down alternately (according to a so-called \u201ccorrugation strategy\u201d), with formation of an open quasi-planar array [47]. "], ["4.2. Structural Properties of Multi-Stranded Nanostructures", "A final consideration applies to the relationship between the periodicity of the assembly and the sequence symmetry of the building unit. A periodic array of the type A will result from the self-association of a single tile (A) along all possible growing directions and will require the sticky ends to be either pairwise complementary (for an even number of arms) or self-complementary (i.e., palindromic, for an even or odd number of arms) [49,56]. If the target object is a lattice of the type (AB)\u2014that is, a periodic array of two distinct tiles, A and B\u2014mutually complementary cohesions must be instead designed [57,58]. Increasing the number of distinct tiles that participate to the assembly reaction means to decrease the sequence symmetry of the system, which, in turn, prevents the assembly of periodic structures of unlimited size. On the other hand, the use of multiple tile connections with a large number of distinct strands enables the realization of molecular pegboards that display many different and singularly addressable positions [59,60]. Thus, whereas the sequence symmetry of the building unit facilitates the formation of large and periodic arrays, sequence asymmetry is the route to achieve higher complexity. In 2012, Yin and coworkers developed a design strategy that extrapolates this concept to the simplest form of tile: a single-stranded DNA (therefore, called the single-stranded tile or SST approach) [50] (Figure 3d). The tile consists of 42 bases divided into four domains, each binding to four local neighboring tiles during self-assembly. Considering each SST as a pixel, the method is based on the generation of a master strand collection that corresponds to a more than 300-pixel canvas, from which appropriate subsets of strands are selected to achieve a desired two-dimensional shape. The same principle has been extended to three-dimensional structures, using so-called \u201cDNA bricks\u201d as building blocks of 3D canvas [61]. The SST and bricks assembly methods thus provide a modular framework for constructing aperiodic nanostructures with a high level of complexity."], ["4.3. On the Thermal Assembly of Multi-Branched DNA Tiles and Their Extended Nanostructures", "While the thermal folding/unfolding of the Holliday junction has been extensively characterized, less has been done on multi-branched DNA tiles and derived arrays. The melting curves of DNA complexes provide a measure of the thermal stability and cooperativity of intermolecular interactions, which are indicated, respectively, by the temperature at the transition midpoint (Tm) and the width of the transition [62]. Initial UV spectroscopy studies on the DAO motif showed a monophasic cooperative melting profile around 60 \u00b0C, almost 20 \u00b0C less than the corresponding duplexes building the same motif [63]. Interestingly, triple crossovers (TX) with similar base compositions melt at approximatively the same temperature as the corresponding DX tiles but show a biphasic profile in which two transitions are visible, with the second being less pronounced and centered at a higher temperature (ca. 75 \u00b0C) [45]. This result indicates that DNA tiles, particularly when large in size and complex in topology, may display domains with distinct thermal properties and an energy profile with multiple transitions. Another example of such a trend is the paranemic motif (PX) [64]. In a PX tile, two double strands are wrapped about each other similarly to the two strands of a double helix, leading to a series of contiguous crossovers at each possible site of strand exchange. The melting curves of PX molecules indicate a cooperative process and a large degree of hysteresis even at extremely slow heating rates. In this case, too, the thermal transitions are biphasic, with an initial pre-melting disruption of the PX structure, followed by full unstacking of the nucleotides. Such systems cannot be idealized as two-state models, calling for alternative approaches that enable the reliable analysis of the data and extrapolation of the thermodynamic parameters of the thermal transition."], ["4.3. On the Thermal Assembly of Multi-Branched DNA Tiles and Their Extended Nanostructures", "A few years later, Sacc\u00e0 and coworkers applied a thermal-dependent FRET spectroscopy method to investigate the thermal properties of selected regions of a four-by-four tile [65]. Contrary to the UV-based approach that gives information on the global thermal stability of the construct, the FRET-dependent method is indicative of the region nearby the two fluorophores and provides a quantitative measurement of their relative distance (within a range of 1 to 10 nm). By positioning the two fluorophores at variable locations of the tile, it was possible to reveal the existence of tile domains characterized by distinct melting temperatures and free energies of transition. When applied to the assembly/disassembly of a periodic lattice of two distinct four-by-four tiles, the method enabled the identification of two well-separated transitions: a first transition at a high temperature (ca. 60 \u00b0C) corresponding to formation of the tile and a second transition at a low temperature (ca. 40 \u00b0C) associated to tile-to-tile cohesion [51] (Figure 3e)."], ["4.3. On the Thermal Assembly of Multi-Branched DNA Tiles and Their Extended Nanostructures", "The thermal stability of tile-to-tile interaction is directly related to the strength of the sticky-ends cohesion. This can be typically enhanced by increasing the GC ratio and/or the length of the complementary DNA segments. On the other hand, excessive hybridization forces should be avoided, as this might result in the trapping of misfolded structures, thus impairing the formation of the desired network. As a rule of thumb, three-to-five nucleobase-long sticky ends are normally sufficient to ensure specificity and stability of the newly formed double-helical bond, while enabling self-correction mechanisms to take place."], ["5. The Scaffold-Based Approach", "In the previous section, we described the structural and thermal properties of multi-stranded DNA objects, historically the first type of structures established in the field of DNA nanotechnology [3]. An extraordinary breakthrough in the construction of nanometer-sized DNA objects occurred in 2006 with the introduction of the scaffolded DNA origami method by Paul Rothemund [5] (for reviews on this subject, see, for example, [8,9,10]). Similar to the Japanese art of paper folding, the DNA origami technique relies on the discontinuous hybridization of a long single-stranded DNA (termed scaffold) to a few hundreds of short oligonucleotides (called staple strands). These latter are computer-designed, such that the outcome of the self-assembly has a desired shape. Contrarily to the multi-stranded method, the origami approach needs a long template sequence as the \u201cmain actor\u201d of the assembly process. Whereas, in the multi-stranded approach, all strands mutually interact one with the other; in the DNA origami method, several staple strands hybridize to a single scaffold rather than with each other. This fundamental difference has a notable impact on the yield of product formation. The multi-stranded method requires that the relative stoichiometry and purity of the interacting strands are carefully controlled and adjusted, resulting in error-prone and lengthy synthetic processes. By contrast, the presence of a scaffold in the origami method ensures that the initial correct arrangement of the first strands favors the further binding of the remaining staples, such that their stoichiometric ratio and purity grade are no more relevant, with obvious advantages in terms of assembly time and efficiency. A deeper discussion on the proposed mechanisms of DNA origami assembly compared to the multi-stranded approach will be given in Section 6."], ["5.1. Structural Properties of Scaffold-Based Assemblies", "The structural properties of DNA origami architectures have been extensively reviewed in the past few years (as an example, see [8,9,10]). We will therefore keep this section intentionally short and invite the interested reader to refer to the vast literature available on this topic. Briefly, the final shape of a DNA origami object is given by the arrangement of crossovers between the connected helices. In the original work by Rothemund [5], several planar origami structures were produced, ranging from simple rectangular shapes to more complex forms such as stars, triangles, and smiley faces. These objects were generated by following a relatively simple design rule: every helix within the structure is connected to two neighboring helices by a regular pattern of crossovers interspaced by 1.5 helical turns, which for B-type DNA, correspond to about 16 base pairs (Figure 4a). This register of crossovers generates interhelical connections every 180\u00b0, leading to a single layer of helices arranged into a planar sheet. The same design principle\u2014however, with distinct crossover patterns\u2014can also be used to generate three-dimensional structures formed by planar sheets connected into prism-like architectures [66,67,68,69,70] or by multiple helices packed together into space-filled objects with different curvatures and twists [6,7,71] or connected through compression and tensile strengths, according to the well-defined tensegrity rules [72] (Figure 4b,c). Finally, and of particular note, are the so-called scaffold-based wireframe structures. Different from the canonical origami structures, in which the helices are organized into parallel raster-fill patterns of honeycomb or square-lattice geometry, wireframe architectures are realized by routing the scaffold through multi-arm junction units that are linked together by one or two double-helical stretches. As each junction may contain from 2 to 12 arms, their mutual connection allows for the nonparallel alignment of several DNA helices. This eventually results in the formation of 2D net-like surfaces with various sizes and shaped cavities, as well as 3D polyhedrons, curved solids and multi-layered frameworks [73,74,75] (Figure 4d\u2013f)."], ["5.2. Thermal Assembly and Disassembly of DNA Origami Structures", "Once the realization of DNA origami structures became feasible for many laboratories around the world, the interest of many scientists in the field moved to the underlying theoretical questions behind the process: \u201cHow does DNA origami self-assembly actually occur?\u201d and \u201cHow is it possible that hundreds of different components associate together into a unique structure, most often in a few hours and\u2014most surprisingly\u2014in very high yields, apparently against all reasonable expectations?\u201d A similar structural problem is encountered in protein folding. In favorable conditions, protein folding occurs spontaneously and in a relatively short time; however, the target structure must be selected from an exponentially large conformational space and clearly cannot be the result of a random search. A possible solution to this paradox is captured by the so-called principle of \u201cminimal frustration\u201d [76], according to which, the folding pathway of a protein towards its most probable configuration is biased by a rapid gain in energy stabilization for conformations progressively similar to the native state. When applied to nucleic acids, free energy landscape formalisms have provided the conceptual frameworks to describe the thermally or mechanically induced transitions of Holliday junctions [28,34], DNA hairpins [77,78,79] and G-quadruplexes [80]. More complex DNA structures, such as, for example, a DNA origami, must therefore obey a similar rule, with the primary sequence, i.e., the set of staple/scaffold base-pairing interactions, encoding the information for folding."], ["5.2. Thermal Assembly and Disassembly of DNA Origami Structures", "Important progress along these lines has been made by monitoring the outcome of the assembly reaction under different experimental conditions or visualizing the formation of intermediate species at different time points of the thermal annealing or melting process. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies have been particularly informative, as they can provide structural details at the single-particle level and have demonstrated the existence of distinct folding pathways [81,82,83,84,85,86,87] (Figure 5a). Spectroscopic methods have instead been mostly employed to gain quantitative information on the free energy associated to the construction or disruption of the origami structure, either at the global level (using UV-Vis absorbance or fluorometric methods) [88,89] (Figure 5b) or restricted to local regions around selected strands (FRET spectroscopy) [87,90] (Figure 5c). Although the majority of these studies rely on the use of a temperature gradient for association or dissociation of a DNA origami structure, both agarose gel electrophoresis and AFM studies demonstrated that correct folding can be achieved at a defined and constant temperature, i.e., isothermally [89] (Figure 5d). Differently from thermal experiments, which give access to the thermodynamic parameters of the process, isothermal data may provide information on the kinetics of the reaction and, thus, are more prone to identifying the sequential order of events that take place during the self-assembly within the time of observation [91]."], ["5.2. Thermal Assembly and Disassembly of DNA Origami Structures", "The wealth of data collected until now on the assembly/disassembly of a DNA origami structure can be distilled into three main points. First, the formation and the disruption of a DNA origami structure are characterized by a certain degree of hysteresis. This means that the process of assembly and disassembly are not reversible, i.e., the two processes travel two different paths of the energy landscape. A way to characterize the degree of hysteresis, i.e., the extent of irreversibility of the transition, is to indicate the difference between the temperature at the mid-point of the transition, Tm, for each of the two processes. The higher this difference, the greater the hysteresis experienced by the system. Each transition, however, takes place in a relatively short interval of temperature around the Tm, reflecting the strong cooperativity of the process. This second aspect has been often associated to the tight connectivity of the strands that constitute the structure. In other words, the strong mechanical coupling between the building units of an origami structure would result in a collective thermal behavior, once a discrete number of entangled strands undergoes a thermal transition. The extent of hysteresis and cooperativity may be modulated by the initial conditions of the assembly reaction, thus leading to the third and final feature of DNA origami constructs, which is the plasticity of the folding path. Indeed, a change in the connectivity of the strands (and, therefore, in the topology of the building motifs) will reflect in a change of folding/unfolding behaviors. In some cases, this may result in the formation of a completely different structure as the consequence of an allosteric propagation of a mechanical transformation from one initial site to the entire set of coupled junctions (Figure 5a). Such a phenomenon has been observed either upon application of an external mechanical load (such as a stretching force [83]) or upon the addition of so-called \u201ctrigger\u201d strands. These triggers typically target the edges of the origami structure, i.e., those exposed regions of the structure where the scaffold inverts its direction, with a direct impact on the entropic penalty of scaffold bending [85,86,87]. Besides a topology-dependent entropic effect, the outcome of an assembly reaction may be also affected by an enthalpic contribution related to the sequence content of the component strands. Intuitively, high melting-temperature (GC-rich) sequences will participate in the folding process at an early stage and will thus play a dominant role in guiding the process, as compared to AT-rich sequences. In other words, while the connectivity of the strands will affect the kind of topological transformation occurring, their base sequences will determine if this transformation constitutes one of the key guiding events of the self-assembly process from which folding will proceed. The basic concept is therefore to identify any possible relationship between the nucleation sites and the topologically frustrated sites [87]. Finally, a further contribution to the folding pathway undoubtedly comes from the environmental conditions of assembly, including the temperature at which the reaction takes place, as well as the type and concentration of salts in the reaction buffer. Recent studies show that the beneficial effect of magnesium ions is largely dependent on the DNA superstructure and that, in some cases, those structures can survive in almost pure water for long times [92]. Only a few examples of DNA nanostructures have been reported in the presence of alternative buffers, such as 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) [68], cacodylate [93] or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) [74]."], ["6. Proposed Models of DNA Nanostructures\u2019 Assembly", "We dedicate this final section to a comparative analysis of the two main DNA design schools, the multi-stranded and the scaffold-based approach, with the purpose to discuss the general guiding principles of complex DNA nanostructures\u2019 assembly. As briefly mentioned above, the main difference between these two approaches relies on the presence or the absence of a template, i.e., a long single-stranded DNA chain that guides the folding of the DNA object. In simple terms, the role of the scaffold is to physically connect the component strands, establishing long-range interactions that bring them spatially closer one to the other. This effect is, of course, more evident at the edges of the structure, where the scaffold inverts its direction and forms a loop. "], ["6. Proposed Models of DNA Nanostructures\u2019 Assembly", "To better understand the implications of a guiding template, Arbona and coworkers developed a minimalist origami model that cleverly recapitulates the essential features of a scaffold-based approach [88,95]. The structure under investigation, referred to as mini-origami, consists of three DNA strands: two short, staple strands, respectively called the outer and inner strands, that bind to two discontinuous or adjacent regions of a third, longer strand, which serves as a scaffold (Figure 5e, top panel). By changing different parameters of the system that selectively address the thermal stability of the single strands, as well as their connectivity and cooperativity, the authors succeeded in generating a model that accounts for both the topological constraint (\u0394Gtop) and the free energy of the hybridization (\u0394GNN) of the connected staples and matches the experimental data of large planar DNA origami objects with surprising precision (Figure 5e, lower panel). The main point of this model is to realize the importance of the scaffold crossovers and to quantify their impact on the self-assembly process. Indeed, whereas staple crossovers are a necessary feature of all DNA nanostructures, as they ensure the intertwining of distinct double helices into the target DNA object, scaffold crossovers, i.e., points of scaffold route inversion, are a prerogative of template-assisted methods. Thus, when two adjacent helices share the same scaffold strand, the addition of an outer staple generates a loop between the two discontinuous regions of hybridization. The longer this loop, the lower the probability of these regions to be close to each other and, thus, the lower the probability of the outer strand to hybridize to both complementary stretches simultaneously. This translates into an entropic penalty that is proportional to the length of the loop. However, when an inner strand is present that binds and bends the loop region, pairing of the outer staple is facilitated, meaning that the entropic penalty will decrease. This mechanism has been clearly demonstrated by UV melting studies and powerfully highlights the concept of topological connectivity between the staples of an origami-like motif (Figure 5e, middle panel). Such a topology-dependent contribution (\u0394Gtop) is responsible for the cooperativity of the thermal transition and is accounted for at the local scale, introducing correlations between the probability of the staples to share the same neighborhood. Clearly, which of the two strands, the outer or the inner, will first bind to the scaffold strand will strongly depend on their thermal stabilities, i.e., ultimately, on their GC content. In other words, the chemical sequence of the strands will define their hierarchical correlations, with a strong impact on the temporal order of events that occur during the annealing and melting of the structure. This sequence-dependent contribution to the local formation of double helices is quantified using the parameters of the nearest-neighbor model (\u0394GNN). Thus, assuming a local equilibrium for the insertion process of the staples, the model of Arbona shows that the folding of each strand depends on the presence of a nearby cluster of folded strands according to both topologically dependent entropic restraints and sequence-related enthalpic contributions to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) hybridization. The nonequilibrium aspects (such as hysteresis) are therefore explained by the fact that the neighborhood of the staples is different in the annealing and melting process. Other theories have been advanced that build on this minimalist approach and consider additional contributions to explain the observed cooperativity of DNA origami folding, as well as the asymmetry of its hysteresis. Such contributions include the coaxial stacking of adjacent domains and Kuhn lengths approximations of the loop, as well as a conformational entropy and binding enthalpy that affect the step-wise folding of DNA origami structures in a loop\u2019s length-dependent fashion [96,97]."], ["6. Proposed Models of DNA Nanostructures\u2019 Assembly", "Whereas the mini-origami model essentially relies on the formation of loops between adjacent connected double helices, an appropriate model of the multi-stranded approach should instead exclude any contribution from scaffold loops and consider only the connectivity of the strands that build up the target shape. One such system, and probably the most representative of a true multi-stranded approach, is the SST (or brick) assembly. Here, structures are kept in place only through a pattern of staple crossovers that join adjacent antiparallel helices in the absence of any scaffold strands. The formidable complexity of such structures has been investigated in several theoretical studies [94,98,99,100,101], due to the surprising rate of successful assembly despite the huge number of component strands. Initial Monte Carlo simulations of such systems were performed, idealizing the single-stranded molecules as particles with four tetrahedrally arranged patches, with each of these patches corresponding to a specific DNA sequence [99]. The results showed the existence of a free-energy barrier to nucleation that increases with the temperature. At high temperatures, nucleation events become rare; at lower temperatures, by contrast, several nuclei can form simultaneously and, subsequently, form large aggregates. Self-assembly of the target structure can therefore successfully take place only within a small window of temperatures, which ensures that the nucleation barrier is low enough to be crossable on experimental time scales but sufficiently high to allow a time separation between consecutive rounds of nucleation and growth, thus suppressing misfolding and aggregation. The study revealed that such a particular requirement can be met, regardless of the choice of the sequences, by using a slow annealing process that starts from high temperatures. In these conditions, the system will always pass through the optimal nucleation regime during cooling and will spend there a sufficient amount of time to enable fast and effective growth. The temperature ramp during the assembly protocol is therefore, here, much more critical than in other DNA design approaches, and a random choice of sequences\u2019 bond energies seems to be even more effective than a homogeneous distribution of the hybridization interactions [100]. Later, the same authors used an off-lattice model [101] to account for the translational and rotational entropy of the single strands, being able to reproduce the main physical phenomena observed in the simpler lattice model. A recent study instead applied oxDNA [102] to calculate the thermodynamics of the tile association. Contrary to previous patchy-particle models (that rely on the broken symmetry of the building units to explain the directional self-assembly behavior), this model describes explicitly the polymeric degrees of freedom of DNA, thus making it more suitable to capture the entropic penalties associated with the binding of successive domains during tile association [94] (Figure 5f). Despite their subtle theoretical differences, all SST models emphasize the importance of an accurate temperature ramp protocol: only in this way can the system cross the nucleation barrier to reach on-pathway species that are necessary to avoid misfolding and aggregation. Upon further cooling, partially formed assemblies can finally stabilize to the full target product. In order to find the optimal temperature for error-free assembly, DNA brick constructs are usually cooled over several days in a very narrow temperature range or isothermally assembled slightly above the average melting temperature of the dsDNA segments. The assembly can be further modulated by the length of the dsDNA segments, their GC contents or splitting them into segments; alternatively, the salinity of the buffer, as well as the addition of molecular crowding agents, can be considered [103]."], ["7. Conclusions", "It may be tempting to view the two different strategies of DNA nanostructures\u2019 assembly, the multi-stranded and the scaffold-based approach, as two faces of the same coin, i.e., as two strategies that, although extremely different, highlight two opposite aspects of a general nucleation-and-growth mechanism. The interpretation of DNA nanostructures\u2019 assembly using the classical nucleation theory typical of crystals\u2019 growth is, however, still a matter of debate in the field. Theoretically different approaches have led to models of SST and bricks assembly that are equally suitable to describe the experimental observations, although their interpretations of the data completely diverge in terms of applicability of the classical nucleation theory [94,100,101]. A similar argument appears when describing the assembly of a DNA origami. Here, staples hybridize to the scaffold and not to the other staples, as in the SST approach, thus raising questions on the correctness of the term \u201cnucleation\u201d to describe the establishment of the initial binding events in such systems [96]. Despite such subtle controversies, the constant refinement of the theoretical models greatly improves our capability to reproduce and predict experimental outcomes and brings us now to the next challenge: Are there alternative ways to guide DNA self-assembly?"], ["7. Conclusions", "The answer to this question is surely affirmative. In the past 40 years, since the very beginning of structural DNA nanotechnology, we witnessed an exciting development of DNA design strategies and assembly protocols, some of which apparently against any realistic possibility of success and, nevertheless, surprisingly effective. The field is therefore still open to further exploration and may probably still hold many surprises that are worth investigating. Along this line, an emerging area of interest is represented by synthetic self-assembly systems that are driven and maintained in out-of-equilibrium conditions. Being capable of autonomous life-like behavior, such DNA-based materials can thus truly emulate the building principles of more complex biological entities. A relevant example of this kind was recently shown by Franco and coworkers [104]. In their work, the disassembly and formation of DNA nanotubes was controlled, respectively, by the addition of RNA invader strands and their digestion by RNase H (Figure 6a). When the invaders bind to the nanotubes\u2019 tiles, it causes them to disassemble. In the presence of RNase H, the RNA invader strands bound to the tiles are degraded, thereby making it possible for tiles to reassemble. The extent of RNA invasion is, in turn, regulated through an autonomous molecular oscillator constituted by several DNA cascade reactions connected into a cyclic pathway. The continuous replenishment of invader strands keeps the process in a nonequilibrium state and results in large-amplitude oscillations of the nanotubes\u2019 lengths as a consequence of alternating growth and degradation events. Capitalizing on previous works on reconfigurable DNA nanostructures, this study represents one of the most complex examples of a successful coupling of a nonlinear dynamic system with a downstream growing pathway. Another recent example instead tackles a conceptual challenge of molecular self-assembly\u2014that is, our limited theoretical understanding of what actually occurs during the process. Indeed, although the final outcome of the reaction is most often a species at the equilibrium regime, the reaction itself happens in out-of-equilibrium conditions, and the application of theoretical models to decipher the path is either not fully appropriate or requires approximations of local equilibrium states. Whitelam and Tamblyn recently proposed an alternative approach based on machine learning to face this problem [105]. The method seeks to control self-assembly without human intervention beyond the specification of which parameters of the system need to be promoted. Most importantly, the algorithm works without prior understanding of what may constitute a \u201cgood\u201d assembly protocol. Using molecular simulations, the authors showed that neural networks trained by evolutionary reinforcement learning can control self-assembly protocols, enhancing the survival of desired structures over possible competitors, thus opening the way to the design and optimization of assembly protocols by artificial intelligence (Figure 6b)."], ["7. Conclusions", "Thus, from the discovery of its structure almost 70 years ago, the DNA molecule has shown us the enormous possibilities held in the simplicity of the Watson-Crick base pairing rule, enabling us to construct, reshape and link structural modules into systems of increasing structural complexity and intriguing dynamic behavior. The next challenge appears to be the creation of self-organizing systems with emergent properties, i.e., capable of emulating a true evolutionary process through progressively fittest species. This, however, will require a change of paradigm, from thermodynamic to kinetic control, from equilibrium to out-of-equilibrium conditions and from reversible to irreversible changes. The challenge is certainly ambitious, but initial efforts in this direction have already shown us that this is possible."]], "pubdate": "2020-11-24", "references": ["30714375", "20562873", "29256499", "5725551", "5637197", "19424153", "17095702", "26795025", "17298017", "19661424", "17165718", "24972230", "1332747", "20482144", "19859932", "28605177", "17036134", "17676841", "8918939", "26201596", "28642234", "18337818", "3663876", "28346457", "25078080", "23794413", "1645997", "3917010", "23239734", "32575260", "3478708", "7919792", "23978049", "32347943", "25941388", "31609632", "19585014", "28654269", "19419184", "31011170", "24888699", "26192207", "19807088", "6197102", "26287459", "2797209", "19824672", "23935069", "26520554", "21594298", "28205515", "14512621", "24767945", "20298191", "16541064", "27276237", "2828644", "29626893", "22162047", "28460037", "23848678", "8130350", "9465037", "16131180", "27378398", "18260075", "8461289", "2017259", "12540916", "9923675", "13063483", "3808954", "17564446", "27628457", "12496933", "29799663", "23197527", "8457571", "15025917", "22660323", "14871096", "23298065", "16187389", "15826117", "22646845", "16351081", "18975864", "13054692", "27890616", "31058228", "6188926", "23537246", "19458720", "9707114", "8394122", "23214819", "30837459", "17215374", "17932299"], "similars": ["33255286", "27186937", "22646845", "24856178", "24871086", "29219966", "35775957", "23537246", "29219965", "26820483", "36327970", "24724843", "24720250", "26071955", "29219968", "18613687", "24772996", "27387283", "18162000", "25940731", "22162047", "24953971", "24583116", "23335504", "31037942", "22395964", "16542743", "24851996", "30842408", "18540657", "19199428", "23210720", "21638269", "28702671", "28651051", "24720350", "18654468", "27628457", "24588320", "32232413", "20644813", "23030709", "31675207", "35662248", "31905142", "23527476", "28806061", "23600590", "29141133", "27553897", "24749534", "30324955", "24803094", "28605177", "29686288", "32438665", "23919535", "32347943", "29926456", "28287117", "26287459", "22101715", "16522024", "22945551", "30837459", "27224641", "32722650", "26149412", "29451771", "33277481", "29995052", "18337818", "30037005", "17654928", "20391568", "30523829", "30351920", "25965916", "30990672", "28858402", "21432950", "29751162", "31615123", "28901745", "24740255", "24720462", "30715893", "22101716", "31861399", "27303951", "17155011", "34818893", "32902966", "21107369", "33048538", "21358626", "34123692", "35668213", "24751596", "21778982", "32549907", "34070149", "34071795", "20385575", "19321429", "24991255", "36039801", "36759713", "35713533", "22022596", "35787471", "23710328"]}, "refs_info": {"30714375": {"title": "Principles and Applications of Nucleic Acid Strand Displacement Reactions.", "abstract": "Dynamic DNA nanotechnology, a subfield of DNA nanotechnology, is concerned with the study and application of nucleic acid strand-displacement reactions.

In addition, the use of toeholds enables the construction of enzyme-free DNA reaction networks exhibiting complex dynamical behavior.

This is evident from the absence of a clear correlation between rate constants for duplex formation and the number of bases in the strand or the sequence. Here we have probed differences between formation times of A-tracts and AT-tracts by studying complementary model strands mainly comprised of adenine (A) and thymine (T) in stopped-flow (SF) experiments. These strands are relevant as DNA replication begins in regions with a large number of AT base pairs. Interpretation of our results is aided by secondary-structure modelling where both the fractions of the different types of structures and the number of paired bases in the lowest-energy ones are determined. The model is based on calculation of free energies using fixed values for enthalpies and entropies associated with base pairing and a stochastic sampling of the possible structures. We find that the strand length affects rates: the activation energy for the formation of short (16-base pairs) A-tracts is larger than that for longer ones (20-base pairs). Activation energies for the formation of AT-tracts are an order of magnitude larger, and larger for shorter strands than for long ones. These higher activation energies are in agreement with the fact that the fraction of unpaired bases in the constituent AT-tract strands is less than in those which comprise the A-tracts. That the pre-structures of the single strands significantly affect rates is also used to rationalise the results obtained for two pairs of complementary 12-mer strands that have the same bases but in a different sequence; we report here similar activation energies as reported earlier and that these are strongly sequence dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that SF can be coupled with the measurement of circular dichroism (CD) in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region, taking advantage of a synchrotron radiation facility, and that CD is useful to probe geometrical structures in the VUV where the absorption by DNA is high.

However, they can be stabilized if their arms contain 16 nucleotide pairs. Ferguson analysis of these junctions in combination with three-arm and four-arm junctions indicates a linear increase in friction constant as the number of arms increases, with the four-arm junction migrating anomalously. The five-arm junction does not appear to have any unusual stacking structure, and all strands show similar responses to hydroxyl radical autofootprinting analysis. By contrast, one strand of the six-arm junction shows virtually no protection from hydroxyl radicals, suggesting that it is the helical strand of a preferred stacking domain. Both junctions are susceptible to digestion by T4 endonuclease VII, which resolves Holliday junctions. However, the putative helical strand of the six-arm junction shows markedly reduced cleavage, supporting the notion that its structure is largely found in a helical conformation.

A typical origami folds primarily into the desired shape, but misfolded structures can kinetically trap the system and reduce the yield. Although adjusting assembly conditions or following empirical design rules can improve yield, well-folded origami often need to be separated from misfolded structures. The problem could in principle be avoided if assembly pathway and kinetics were fully understood and then rationally optimized. To this end, here we present a DNA origami system with the unusual property of being able to form a small set of distinguishable and well-folded shapes that represent discrete and approximately degenerate energy minima in a vast folding landscape, thus allowing us to probe the assembly process. The obtained high yield of well-folded origami structures confirms the existence of efficient folding pathways, while the shape distribution provides information about individual trajectories through the folding landscape. We find that, similarly to protein folding, the assembly of DNA origami is highly cooperative; that reversible bond formation is important in recovering from transient misfoldings; and that the early formation of long-range connections can very effectively enforce particular folds. We use these insights to inform the design of the system so as to steer assembly towards desired structures.

But despite reasonably strong interstrand interactions, initial contacts frequently dissociate because typical configurations in which they form differ from typical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium ensemble. Initial contacts must be stabilized by two or three base pairs before full zippering is likely, resulting in negative effective activation enthalpies.

We have modeled these double-crossover structures in an oligonucleotide system. Whereas the relative orientations of the helical domains must be specified in designing these molecules, there are two broad classes of the molecules, the parallel, DP, and antiparallel, DA, molecules. The distance between crossover points must be specified as multiples of half-turns, in order to avoid torsional stress in this system; hence, there are two further subdivisions, those double-crossover molecules separated by odd, O, and even, E, numbers of half-turns. In addition, the parallel molecules with odd numbers of half-turns between crossovers must be divided into those with an excess major or wide-groove separation, W, or those with an excess minor- or narrow-groove separation, N. We have constructed models of all five of these classes, DAE, DAO, DPE, DPOW, and DPON. DPE molecules containing 1 and 2 helical turns between crossovers have been constructed; the DAE molecule contains 1 turn between crossovers, and the DAO, DPOW, and DPON molecules contain 1.5 helical turns between crossovers. None of the parallel molecules is well-behaved; the molecules either dissociate or form multimers when visualized on native polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, antiparallel molecules form single bands when assayed in this fashion. Hydroxyl radical autofootprinting analysis of these molecules reveals protection at expected sites of crossover and of occlusion, suggesting that all the complexes contain linear helix axes that are roughly coplanar between crossovers. However, the DPOW molecule and the DPE molecule with 2 turns between crossovers show decreased protection in the portion between crossovers, suggesting that their helices may bow in response to charge repulsion. We conclude that the helices between parallel double crossovers must be shielded from each other or distorted from linearity if they are to participate in recombination. We have analyzed the possibilities of branch migration and crossover isomerization in double-crossover molecules. Parallel molecules need no sequence symmetry beyond homology to branch migrate, but the sequence symmetry requirements for antiparallel molecules restrict migration to directly repetitive segments that iterate the sequence between crossovers.

While DNA served as the pioneer building material in nucleic acid nanotechnology, RNA continues to emerge as viable alternative material with its own distinct advantages for nanoconstruction. Several complementary assembly strategies have been used to build a diverse set of RNA nanostructures having unique structural attributes and the ability to self-assemble in a highly programmable and controlled manner. Of the different strategies, the architectonics approach uniquely endeavors to understand integrated structural RNA architectures through the arrangement of their characteristic structural building blocks.

A number of nonclassical pairing patterns are possible between or among DNA strands; these interactions result in formation of unusual structures that include, but are not limited to, G-quadruplexes, i-motifs, triplexes, and parallel-stranded duplexes. These structures create greater diversity of DNA-based building blocks for nanomaterials and have certain advantages over conventional duplex DNA, such as enhanced thermal stability and sensitivity to chemical stimuli. In this Account, we briefly introduce these alternative DNA structures and describe in detail their utilization in a variety of nanomaterials and nanomachines. The field of DNA \"nano-oddities\" emerged in the late 1990s when for the first time a DNA nanomachine was designed based on equilibrium between B-DNA and noncanonical, left-handed Z-DNA. Soon after, \"proof-of-principle\" DNA nanomachines based on several DNA \"oddities\" were reported. These machines were set in motion by the addition of complementary strands (a principle used by many B-DNA-based nanodevices), by the addition of selected cations, small molecules, or proteins, or by a change in pH or temperature. Today, we have fair understanding of the mechanism of action of these devices, excellent control over their performance, and knowledge of basic principles of their design. pH sensors and pH-controlled devices occupy a central niche in the field. They are usually based on i-motifs or triplex DNA, are amazingly simple, robust, and reversible, and create no waste apart from salt and water. G-quadruplex based nanostructures have unusually high stability, resist DNase and temperature, and display high selectivity toward certain cations. The true power of using these \"nano-oddities\" comes from combining them with existing nanomaterials (e.g., DNA origami, gold nanoparticles, graphene oxide, or mesoporous silica) and integrating them into existing mechanical and optoelectronic devices. Creating well-structured junctions for these interfaces, finding appropriate applications for the vast numbers of reported \"nano-oddities\", and proving their biological innocence comprise major challenges in the field.

Here we show that natural assembly principles can be combined with the methods of DNA origami to produce gigadalton-scale structures with controlled sizes. DNA sequence information is used to encode the shapes of individual DNA origami building blocks, and the geometry and details of the interactions between these building blocks then control their copy numbers, positions and orientations within higher-order assemblies.

Hierarchical multistage assembly of simple sets of tiles can in principle overcome this limitation, but so far has not been sufficiently robust to enable successful implementation of larger structures using DNA origami tiles. Here we show that by using simple local assembly rules that are modified and applied recursively throughout a hierarchical, multistage assembly process, a small and constant set of unique DNA strands can be used to create DNA origami arrays of increasing size and with arbitrary patterns. We illustrate this method, which we term 'fractal assembly', by producing DNA origami arrays with sizes of up to 0.5 square micrometres and with up to 8,704 pixels, allowing us to render images such as the Mona Lisa and a rooster.

Given the mechanical properties of single- and double-stranded DNA, it is not surprising to find many variants of wireframe and tensegrity constructions in the emerging field of DNA nanotechnology, in which structures of almost arbitrary shape can be built with nanometer precision. The success of DNA self-assembly relies on the well-controlled hybridization of complementary DNA strands. Consequently, understanding the fundamental physical properties of these molecules is essential. Many experiments have shown that double-stranded DNA (in its most commonly occurring helical form, the B-form) behaves in a first approximation like a relatively stiff cylindrical beam with a persistence length of many times the length of its building blocks, the base pairs. However, it is harder to assign a persistence length to single-stranded DNA. Here, normally the Kuhn length is given, a measure that describes the length of individual rigid segments in a freely jointed chain. This length is on the order of a few nucleotides. Two immediate and important consequences arise from this high flexibility: single-stranded DNA is almost always present in a coiled conformation, and it behaves, just like all flexible polymers in solution, as an entropic spring. In this Account, we review the relation between the mechanical properties of DNA and design considerations for wireframe and tensegrity structures built from DNA.

Even larger DNA origami structures are possible, but manufacturing and manipulating an increasingly long scaffold strand remains a challenge. An alternative and more readily scalable approach involves the assembly of DNA bricks, which each consist of four short binding domains arranged so that the bricks can interlock. This approach does not require a scaffold; instead, the short DNA brick strands self-assemble according to specific inter-brick interactions.

On the other hand, the unique self-recognition properties of DNA, determined by the strict Watson-Crick rules of base pairing, make this material ideal for the creation of self-assembling, predesigned nanostructures. The construction of such structures is one of the main focuses of the thriving area of DNA nanotechnology, where several assembly strategies have been employed to build increasingly complex DNA nanostructures.

In addition to their remarkable performance as frameworks for other species, DNA constructs also possess interesting dynamic properties, which have led to their use in logic circuits, drug delivery vehicles, and molecular walkers. Although DNA nanostructures have become increasingly complex, the development of tools to study them has lagged.

This Account details the work from our laboratories toward developing single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) methodologies for the structural and dynamic characterization of wireframe DNA nanostructures, one at a time. The methods described herein provide us with two separate yet related sets of information: First, we can statically examine the nanostructures one by one to assess their robustness, structural fidelity, and morphology. This is primarily done using two-color stepwise photobleaching, wherein we can examine the subunit stoichiometry of our assemblies before and after various perturbations to the structures. For example, we can introduce length mismatches to cause the nanotube to bend or perform strand displacement reactions to generate single-stranded, flexible analogues of our materials. Second, due to the unmatched spatiotemporal resolution of SMF techniques, we can study the dynamic character of these assemblies by implementing structural changes to the nanotube and monitoring them in real time. With this structural and dynamic information in hand, our groups have additionally developed new tools for the improved construction of DNA nanotubes, inspired by solid-phase DNA synthesis. By assembling the nanotubes in a stepwise manner, highly monodisperse nanostructures of any desired length can be made without a template strand. In this way, unique building blocks can also be added sequence-specifically, allowing for the production of user-defined scaffolds to organize nanoscale materials in three dimensions. This method, in combination with our imaging and analysis protocols, may be extended to assemble and inspect other supramolecular constructs in a controlled manner.

These cross-tiles have 16 unpaired nucleosides in the central loop at the junction of the four duplex stems. The importance of the centralized unpaired nucleosides to the structure's thermodynamic stability and self-assembly is unknown. Cross-tile DNA nanostructures were designed and constructed from nine single-stranded DNAs with four shell strands, four arms, and a central loop containing 16 unpaired bases.

This approach is used to define angular vertices through readily accessible backbone-branched DNAs (bbDNAs). We demonstrate how such bbDNAs can be used as a new building block in DNA nanoconstruction to obtain well-defined nanostructures.

Three approaches that can be employed for uniquely coding origami-origami linkages are presented. Such coding not only provides the energetics for tethering the species but also uniquely designates the relative orientation of the origami building blocks. The strength of the coding approach implemented in our laboratory is demonstrated using examples of oligomers ranging from finite multimers composed of four, six, and eight origami structures to semi-infinite polymers (100mers). Two approaches to finite array design and the series of assembly steps that each requires are discussed.

The folding transition is cooperative and, as in the case of proteins, is governed by information encoded in the polymer sequence. A typical origami folds primarily into the desired shape, but misfolded structures can kinetically trap the system and reduce the yield. Although adjusting assembly conditions or following empirical design rules can improve yield, well-folded origami often need to be separated from misfolded structures. The problem could in principle be avoided if assembly pathway and kinetics were fully understood and then rationally optimized. To this end, here we present a DNA origami system with the unusual property of being able to form a small set of distinguishable and well-folded shapes that represent discrete and approximately degenerate energy minima in a vast folding landscape, thus allowing us to probe the assembly process. The obtained high yield of well-folded origami structures confirms the existence of efficient folding pathways, while the shape distribution provides information about individual trajectories through the folding landscape. We find that, similarly to protein folding, the assembly of DNA origami is highly cooperative; that reversible bond formation is important in recovering from transient misfoldings; and that the early formation of long-range connections can very effectively enforce particular folds. We use these insights to inform the design of the system so as to steer assembly towards desired structures.

To overcome this problem, inspired by the self-assembly systems in nature, which feature the dynamically controlled self-assembly of biopolymers, we have previously proposed a self-assembly system that uses a dynamic liquid/liquid interface with dimensions in the micrometer regime, thereby allowing polymers to self-assemble under precisely controlled nonequilibrium conditions. Herein, we further extend this system to the creation of hierarchical self-assembled architectures of polysaccharides. A natural polysaccharide, \u03b2-1,3-glucan (SPG), and water were injected into opposite \"legs\" of microfluidic devices that had a Y-shape junction, so that two solvents would gradually mix in the down stem, thereby causing SPG to spontaneously self-assemble along the flow in a head-to-tail fashion, mainly through hydrophobic interactions. In the initial stage, several SPG nanofibers would self-assemble at the Y-junction owing to the shearing force, thereby creating oligomers with a three-way junction point. This unique structure, which could not be created through conventional mixing procedures, has a divergent self-assembly capability. The dynamic flow allows the oligomers to interact continuously with SPG nanofibers that are fed into the Y-junction, thus amplifying the nanostructure along the flow to form SPG networks. Consequently, we were able to create stable, centimeter-length macroscopic polysaccharide strands under the selected flow conditions, which implies that SPG nanofibers were assembled hierarchically in a supramolecular fashion in the dynamic flow. Microscopic observations, including SEM and AFM analysis, revealed the existence of clear hierarchical structures inside the obtained strand. The network structures self-assembled to form sub-micrometer-sized fibers. The long fibers further entangled with each other to give stable micrometer-sized fibers, which finally assembled to form the macroscopic strands, in which the final stabilities in the macroscopic regime were governed by that of the network structures in the nanometer regime.

Adaptive reconfiguration of cytoskeletal networks, for example, enables cellular shape change, movement, and cargo transport and plays a key role in driving complex processes such as division and differentiation. The cellular cytoskeleton is a self-assembling polymer network composed of simple filaments, so reconfiguration often occurs through the rearrangement of its component filaments' connectivities. DNA nanotubes have emerged as promising building blocks for constructing programmable synthetic analogs of cytoskeletal networks. Nucleating seeds can control when and where nanotubes grow, and capping structures can bind nanotube ends to stop growth. Such seeding and capping structures, collectively called termini, can organize nanotubes into larger architectures. However, these structures cannot be selectively activated or inactivated in response to specific stimuli to rearrange nanotube architectures, a key property of cytoskeletal networks. Here, we demonstrate how selective regulation of the binding affinity of DNA nanotube termini for DNA nanotube monomers or nanotube ends can direct the reconfiguration of nanotube architectures. Using DNA hybridization and strand displacement reactions that specifically activate or inactivate four orthogonal nanotube termini, we demonstrate that nanotube architectures can be reconfigured by selective addition or removal of distinct termini.

The virus fails to grow in embryonic chick tissue cultures or in fertilized egg preparations. 2. Some relationship can be demonstrated between the amount of nervous tissue and the infectivity of the culture. 3. Optimum titers of virus potency (10(-6)) can be obtained by adjusting the pH of the growing culture at 7.3 to 7.6. 4. A simple pH inactivation curve for virus alone and for virus when actively growing in tissue culture has been obtained. 5. The rate of virus propagation, as determined by potency tests in mice, has been established for cultures which were seeded with large or small amounts of virus. The murine virus \"grows\" relatively fast. The optimum titer for a large inoculum was reached in 19 hours, for a small inoculum in 72 hours. 6. With extended subcultivation in vitro the cultured virus shows a loss of infectivity for mice by peripheral injection. However, potency as determined by intracerebral injection remains constant. 7. Mice surviving inoculation of culture virus by routes other than intracerebral acquire a relative resistance to reinfection with mouse passage virus. 8. The murine culture virus passes without difficulty through collodion membranes with an A.P.D. of 30 mmicro. Its particle size may therefore be estimated as lying between 10 to 15 mmicro. 9. On a basis of in vitro activity and cross infection, the murine culture virus is distinct from the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis. 10. Murine culture virus may be used as an interfering agent to block infection with poliomyelitis virus in monkeys. The interaction between the two viruses seems to be quantitatively limited. Such interference, with the present potency of culture virus, operates effectively only against comparatively small doses of monkey virus.", "pubdate_sims": "1942-06-01"}, "20240022": {"title": "The role of antibody in experimental poliomyelitis; reproducibility of endpoint in a mouse neutralization test with Lansing poliomyelitis virus.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1947-05"}, "20246975": {"title": "Action of plant tissues on the pH of the media in which they are grown.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1947-02-10"}, "20250482": {"title": "Experimental infection of flies with human poliomyelitis virus.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1947-06"}, "20256068": {"title": "Regenerative tissues in in vitro culture.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1947-03-03"}, "20264681": {"title": "The neutralization of the mouse-adapted Lansing strain of poliomyelitis virus by the serum of patients and contacts.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1947-09"}, "20268422": {"title": "The significance of protection tests with the serum of man and other animals against the Lansing strain of poliomyelitis virus.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1947-11"}, "20274218": {"title": "Attempts to adapt a human strain of poliomyelitis virus from man to rodents.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1946-11-15"}, "20274241": {"title": "Cultivation of the murine SK strain of poliomyelitis virus in developing eggs.", "abstract": "", "pubdate_sims": "1946-10"}, "20275685": {"title": "The effect of penicillin on tissue cultures; 2.

very young mice, less than 4 weeks of age, usually die without showing signs of paralysis. 3. adult mice often show no signs of infection after an intracerebral inoculation of virus. a number of these mice, although showing no signs of paralysis, nevertheless have become infected, a fact which is demonstrated by recovery of the virus from the mice as well as by histopathological studies. 4. intranasal instillation of the virus is the only other method of producing the infection. this method, however, produces paralysis in only a small percentage of the mice. following intranasal instillation of the virus, there often develops a slight immunity to a subsequent intracerebral injection of virus. 5. the paralysis in the surviving mice recedes gradually, but a permanent residual paralysis, usually of the hind legs, is almost invariable. such mice, however, are virus carriers, as the virus can be recovered from the spinal cord for 1 year after infection. 6. paralyzed mice are immune to a subsequent intracerebral injection of the virus. there is evidence that neutralizing substances are present in the immune mice. a considerable proportion of the mice which have remained

It shows no signs of dying out. On the other hand, it gives no evidence of becoming more pathogenic to the species through successive passage. The period of incubation remains variable and the percentage of takes has not increased. Whether eventually a virus can be obtained which is of heightened virulence to rabbits is problematic. All inoculations are by no means successful. The animals show great individual differences in susceptibility to the virus, as is evidenced by the fact that out of fifty-four rabbits inoculated, only twenty-two, or about 40 per cent, succumbed. This fact may explain the negative results of other investigators. At several points in the series of experiments it was thought that the strain had died out. As many as six rabbits have been inoculated one after the other before the virus would catch again. The age of the rabbits is important in considering the susceptibility. From the limited data at our command, adult rabbits are resistant, and there appears to be an abrupt increase in resistance between the age of 6 and 8 weeks; that is, rabbits under 6 weeks are more susceptible to the virus. There seems to be a parallel between the age incidence of this disease in rabbits and spontaneous poliomyelitis in man. The age incidence of poliomyelitis in man is indicated by the term \"infantile paralysis.\" Several methods of inoculation have proved successful; thus the rabbits have succumbed as a result of introducing the virus directly into the brain, by injecting it into a peripheral nerve, or directly into the circulation, or by placing it upon the uninjured nasal mucosa. The symptoms produced show more or less departure from the symptoms of poliomyelitis as seen in the spontaneous disease in man and in the experimental disease in the monkey. There are two distinct pictures recognizable. In one there is paralysis of one or more of the extremities which progresses until death, resembling somewhat the symptoms of the experimental disease in the monkey. This we have designated the progressive type. The other group is included in what we have called the fulminating type. The symptoms are explosive in character, with extreme weakness amounting to prostration, terminating in death in a few hours, attendant upon respiratory failure. The mode of inoculation seems to have little effect upon the type of symptoms produced. The period of incubation is variable and apparently does not depend upon the method of inoculation. The period varied from 2 to 41 days, with an average of 12 days. The two extremes both occurred after intracranial injection. After intranasal insufflation the incubation period was short, being in each case 2 days, followed by symptoms of the fulminating type. The placing of the virus into the nose seems to be an effective method, but is as uncertain as other routes, as only three out of nine rabbits tested in this manner succumbed. The disease produced by this route was particularly virulent. The virus shows no tendency to become fixed. The period of incubation is as variable in the eighth generation as in the first, and the virus has shown no tendency towards increasing virulence through successive passage, in these respects differing from the virus of rabies. We have found the virus to be filterable. An emulsion of the central nervous matter of a rabbit of the first generation passed through a Berkefeld filter, and injected intracerebrally into another rabbit, resulted in death, preceded by symptoms of the fulminating type. Virus (unfiltered) from this rabbit was transferred successfully to two other rabbits. The lesions, while definite and consistent throughout the series, lack the distinctive features of the pathologic picture of poliomyelitis in man and the monkey. Capillary congestion, punctate hemorrhages, degeneration of the motor cells, satellitosis, and more or less cellular infiltration of the gray matter of the cord and medulla are found, but perivascular infiltration is absent and the infiltrating cells are not lymphocytic in character. One of the most striking features of this investigation is the way in which rabbits and monkeys react to the same virus. The disease in the rabbit presents certain clinical resemblances to the experimental disease in the monkey and also to the spontaneous disease in children. On the other hand, the symptoms show marked variation from those seen in the monkey and in man. The picture has not the same constancy in rabbits and could not in most cases be recognized clinically as poliomyelitis. There are still more marked differences in the pathology. While it is true that the brunt of the attack in the rabbit falls upon the gray matter of the cord and medulla, the appearance of the lesions under the microscope shows such differences from the lesions of experimental poliomyelitis in monkeys, as well as the natural disease in man, as to suggest two distinct infections. It is more reasonable, however, to assume that we are dealing with a modified form of poliomyelitis; that the rabbit reacts differently to the virus than the monkey or man; and that the disease produced in rabbits by us and others is in fact poliomyelitis. So far as we know, no other virus produces such differences in two animal species. Smallpox is so profoundly altered in the cow that it took almost 100 years to prove Jenner's assumption that cowpox is a modified form of smallpox. However, the pock of vaccinia is a correct counterpart both clinically and pathologically of the pock of variola. If the virus of poliomyelitis may be so altered in the rabbit as scarcely to be recognizable, may it not be still more profoundly changed in other animals? The conjecture then arises that poliomyelitis, instead of being limited naturally to man and experimentally to monkeys, may in fact occur in other animals in unnoticed or unrecognized form. If this should prove true, it may be a source of human infection and may help to solve the problem of prevention.", "pubdate_sims": "1916-04-01"}, "19868883": {"title": "FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE PHENOMENA ENCOUNTERED IN ATTEMPTING TO TRANSMIT VARICELLA TO RABBITS.", "abstract": "1.

Virus III, heated 10 minutes at 55 degrees C., will not produce visible reactions in the skin of rabbits. 3. Virus III passes through Berkefeld N and V filters. 4. The data obtained so far indicate that the best method of preserving Virus III in an active state is to filter the testicular emulsions containing the virus, add glycerol to the filtrate up to 40 per cent of the total volume, seal with vaseline, and store on ice. 5. Viable Virus III produces a definite immunity in rabbits which persists for at least 6 months. The immunity follows intradermal, intratesticular, intravenous, intracerebral, or intranasal inoculations of the virus. 6. A single intradermal injection of Virus III, which has been killed by heat, will not produce a demonstrable immunity in rabbits. 7. No passive immunity to Virus III could be demonstrated in rabbits which had received intravenous injections of 5 to 10 cc. of immune rabbit serum 24 hours previously. 8. Immune rabbit serum neutralizes Virus III either in vitro, or locally in a rabbit's skin when the immune serum and the virus are injected into the same part of the skin at or about the same time. 9. Three strains of the virus under investigation are immunologically identical. 10. Virus III and vaccine virus are immunologically distinct. 11.

No passive immunity to Virus III could be demonstrated in rabbits which had received intravenous injections of 5 to 10 cc. of serum or whole blood from patients convalescent from varicella. 13. Sera from two normal adults and from fourteen patients convalescent from varicella did not neutralize Virus III in vitro. 14. Rabbits could not be actively immunized against Virus III by injections of whole blood, vesicle fluid, or nasal washings from patients with varicella. 15. Four of twenty sera collected from stock rabbits of different ages, 20 per cent, neutralized Virus III in vitro. The animals whose sera neutralized Virus III failed to show a reaction at the site of intradermal inoculations with the same virus. About 15 per cent of 200 young stock rabbits (1,800 gm.) used in routine transfers were found to be refractory to Virus III, as evidenced by a failure to react to intradermal inoculations of the virus. 16. No susceptibility to Virus III was observed in guinea pigs, mice, or monkeys. 17. A volunteer who had never suffered from varicella experienced no general reaction and only a mild local one following an intradermal inoculation of Virus III.

All the cases, with the exception of one (Case II), were characteristic cases of idiopathic herpes zoster and the question of their being cases of so called zosteriform herpes or symptomatic herpes zoster can hardly be raised. As regards Case II, if this case occurred alone, there might be some doubt as to its nature on account of the mildness of the symptoms and the small area of skin involvement. Taken in connection with Cases III and IV, however, which occurred in the same ward and in patients who were quite closely in contact with Patient II, it seems fairly reasonable to assume that they were all of the same character. Cases of herpes zoster have been extremely rare in this hospital and the occurrence of three cases in the same ward within a very short period of time suggests very strongly a transference of infection from one case to the other. That Case II was not one of herpes simplex also seems fairly certain from the negative results obtained by inoculation of rabbits' eyes with vesicle material. In making the animal experiments we employed various methods which were suggested largely by the technique used by previous observers, especially by those who have reported results which were considered positive. In making inoculations into the corneas the technique recommended by Lipsch\u00fctz was employed as far as possible. Young rabbits were used and the material was obtained from fresh vesicles early in the disease and inoculated with as little delay as possible. The material injected into rabbits' eyes was obtained from seven cases and twenty-four rabbits were used. In judging of the results obtained in this kind of experimentation great caution must be observed. Our experience convinces us that slight opacities occurring along the lines of scarification and mild conjunctivitis cannot be held to indicate the effect of a specific virus. As regards the interpretation of the microscopic changes found, we were quite familiar with the appearance of intranuclear inclusion bodies as seen in the lesions of experimental herpes simplex and the filterable virus (Virus III) indigenous to rabbits described by Rivers and Tillett (5). We also had no difficulty in imding intranuclear inclusions in the sections of skin removed from patients. It is not likely, therefore, that these structures were overlooked in our study of the sections. Briefly stated, although the material studied was satisfactory and in spite of the fact that a considerable number of animals were used for each case, we have been unable to confirm the observations of Lipsch\u00fctz regarding the experimental production of specific lesions in the corneas of rabbits. We realize that this is only negative evidence and therefore not of conclusive importance in view of Lipsch\u00fctz's observations. It indicates, however, that the production of specific lesions in rabbits' eyes with material from herpes zoster vesicles is extremely difficult and that successful results may be a matter of chance, depending, possibly, on peculiar susceptibility on the part of the rabbits. In view of the fact, however, that a careful analysis of the positive results reported by other observers shows that the conclusions were based on insufficient evidence, we believe that further work is necessary before the successful inoculation of the rabbits' corneas with herpes zoster virus can be accepted as fully demonstrated. To make the evidence convincing specific lesions should be obtained with a fair degree of regularity and the virus should be successfully transmitted through at least two generations. Apparently the latter was not attempted by Lipsch\u00fctz. Intracerebral inoculations into three rabbits with material from two cases (Nos. I and IV) were made. Two rabbits were also inoculated intraspinally with material from one case (No. IV). None of these animals showed any reaction. In the case of one of the animals inoculated into the brain (Case I) although this rabbit showed no symptoms, we thought it conceivable that the susceptibility of the species for the virus might be so slight that no obvious lesion had been produced. Nevertheless it was thought that the virus might possibly remain alive at the seat of inoculation and by repeated transfers become adapted to the rabbit. This phenomenon has been observed by Noguchi with vaccine virus, and by Rivers and Tillett with the rabbit virus isolated by these workers. This possibility was tested by us by making serial corneal and brain inoculations. Corneal transfers were carried through fourteen animals in series, and brain transfers through ten. No specific lesions developed in any of the animals. The work of Teague and Goodpasture suggested that the skin might be rendered more susceptible to infection by previous treatment with tar. Material from two cases (Nos. I and VIII) was inoculated into the tarred skin of guinea pigs and rabbits. The material was injected intracutaneously and also rubbed into the scarified skin. No reaction was obtained in any of the animals. Finally, the transmission of herpes zoster to monkeys was attempted. Blanc and Caminopetros, and Bastai and Busacca, as discussed in the review of the literature, inoculated monkeys (Macacus) in various ways, without success. It was thought possible that although monkeys of the genus Macacus might be refractory, monkeys of another genus might prove susceptible. Consequently, besides the inoculation of two Macacus monkeys, attempts were made to infect five vervets. Moreover, in view of the fact that the virus of vaccinia and the rabbit virus of Rivers and Tillett could be successfully cultivated in the testicle, intratesticular inoculations were employed. The testicles were removed at varying periods following inoculation. Numerous sections of these testicles were made and examined, but in no instance were any lesions found which could be interpreted as specific. No cells containing intranuclear inclusion bodies were found. These experiments, therefore, have also led to purely negative results. This report of our work is made at the present time because a considerable amount of literature has been published which gives the impression that herpes zoster has been successfully transmitted to animals. Although the observations of Lipsch\u00fctz are suggestive, it is important that they be confirmed by further investigations. Until herpes zoster can be regularly transmitted to animals and cross-immunity tests be carried out, the relation of the virus of herpes zoster to that of herpes simplex remains a matter of speculation. In view of the fact that herpes simplex can be easily and regularly transmitted to rabbits, whereas in the hands of a large number of investigators similar experiments with herpes zoster are completely negative, it does not seem likely that the etiological agent concerned in these two diseases can be absolutely identical. The question of the identity or non-identity of herpes zoster and varicella is even more difficult to answer, because at present neither of these infections is readily transmissible to animals. The work of Kundratitz is extremely interesting. His observations, aside from indicating a close immunological relationship between herpes zoster and varicella, are important in that they seem to show the presence of a transmissible virus in the vesicles of herpes zoster. The only question that arises is whether the cases of herpes zoster from which Kundratitz was able to make successful transfers were true cases of idiopathic herpes zoster.", "pubdate_sims": "1925-11-30"}, "19867819": {"title": "LOCALIZATION OF THE VIRUS AND PATHOGENESIS OF EPIDEMIC POLIOMYELITIS.", "abstract": "The virus of poliomyelitis is capable of penetrating the retina without producing apparent injury, to reach the central nervous organs. The virus injected into the blood is deposited promptly in the spleen and bone marrow, but not in the kidneys, spinal cord, or brain. Notwithstanding the affinity which the nervous tissues possess for the virus, it is not removed from the blood by the spinal cord and brain until the choroid plexus and blood vessels have suffered injury. The intervertebral ganglia remove the virus from the blood earlier than do the spinal cord and brain. An aseptic inflammation produced by an intraspinous injection of horse serum facilitates and insures the passage of the virus to the central nervous organs, and the production of paralysis. The unaided virus, even when present in large amounts, passes inconstantly from the blood to the substance of the spinal cord and brain. When the virus within the blood fails to gain access to the central nervous organs, and to set up paralysis, it is destroyed by the body, in course of which destruction it undergoes, as a result of the action of the spleen and, perhaps, other organs, diminution of virulence. The histological lesions that follow the intravenous injections of the virus in some but not in all cases differ from those which result from intraneural modes of infection. In escaping from the blood into the spinal cord and brain, the virus causes a lymphatic invasion of the choroid plexus and widespread perivascular infiltration, and from the latter cellular invasions enter the nervous tissues. A similar lymphoid infiltration of the choroid plexus may arise also from an intracerebral injection of the virus. The histological lesions present in the central nervous organs in human cases of poliomyelitis correspond to those that arise from the intraneural method of infection in the monkey. The virus in transit from the blood through the cerebrospinal fluid to the substance of the spinal cord and brain is capable of being neutralized by intraspinous injection of immune serum, whereby the production of paralysis is averted. Carmin in a sterile and finely divided state introduced into the meninges and ventricles sets up an aseptic inflammation, but is quickly taken up by cells, including ependymal cells. When an aseptic inflammation has been previously established by means of horse serum, or when the nervous tissues are already injured by the poliomyelitic virus, the pigment appears to enter the ependymal cells more freely. The experiments described support the view that infection in epidemic poliomyelitis in man is local and neural, and by way of the lymphatics, and not general and by way of the blood. Hence they uphold the belief that the infection atrium is the upper respiratory mucous membrane.", "pubdate_sims": "1914-09-01"}, "19870279": {"title": "EPIDEMIC TREMOR, AN ENCEPHALOMYELITIS AFFECTING YOUNG CHICKENS.", "abstract": "A new disease having a characteristic and well defined symptom complex is described as occurring in young chickens in four New England states. Tremor, principally of the head and neck, and progressive ataxia are the characteristic symptoms, either or both of which may be present in a single bird. Age at onset in field epidemics ranges from 3 days to 6 weeks, with a majority of cases reported at 3 weeks. Morbidity in commercial flocks ranges from 5 to 50 per cent; mortality in affected hatches may be 50 per cent. The disease may or may not recur in successive hatches, and in the same flock in successive years. Although birds may survive an attack of the disease, nervous symptoms persist in a majority of cases. There is no evidence that nutritional factors are involved. Normal chickens have not contracted the disease by contact with affected birds. The disease has been reproduced in normal chickens by intracerebral inoculation of brain and spinal cord from affected birds. Twenty brain-to-brain passages have been made up to the present time. The incubation period in laboratory passages ranges from 6 to 44 days with symptoms appearing usually between 21 and 28 days. The proportion of inoculated birds developing symptoms has increased with successive passages. The infective agent in the brain has survived in 50 per cent glycerine for 69 days. No organism has been cultivated. The disease has been reproduced after inoculation with bacteriologically sterile filtrates obtained with Seitz and Berkefeld N filters. Attempts to demonstrate the presence of the infective agent in the chicken embryo have been inconclusive. Chicks hatched from eggs laid by birds which had survived the disease were not infected, nor were they immune to inoculation at 6 weeks of age. The characteristic lesion of the disease consists of microscopic focal collections of glia cells, perivascular infiltration, degeneration of Purkinje's cells, and degeneration of nerve cells. Foci of infiltration are present throughout the brain and spinal cord. In the viscera of birds from field epidemics, microscopic focal infiltrations of cells of the lymphoid series are often found.

The appearance of the bacillus in man and its behavior under artificial cultivation, and in the tissues of lower animals, should be considered in order that comparisons may be drawn. In their studies with the organism under cultivation, Duval and Gurd pointed out that the long, slender, and beaded appearance of the leprosy bacillus described by Hansen, in 1872, is lost when removed for several generations from the parent stem, and under artificial cultivation the organism becomes unbeaded, short, and coccoid. Duval also noted that these changes in morphology were always followed by rapid multiplication of the organism. Duval argues, a priori, that the bacillus is not in a favorable environment in the human tissues. If these deductions are correct, the morphology of the leprosy bacillus should vary according to the resistance offered by the tissues of different animals. The resistance of the human host to the leprosy bacillus becomes more evident in the light of the clinical aspect of the disease. The long period of incubation, the duration of the disease, and the disappearance of the bacilli preceding the healing of the infected foci show that the resistance offered to the bacillus by the human tissues is not to be overestimated. This opinion is confirmed when the behavior of the leprosy bacillus under cultivation and in the tissues of various mammals is compared. When cats, rabbits, bats, guinea pigs, and rats are inoculated either below the skin or into the peritoneal cavity with large quantities of Bacillus leprae, a slight local reaction follows within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, but no definite lesions are produced and the bacilli soon disappear. The resistance of some animals to Bacillus leprae is well illustrated by two cats which were inoculated subcutaneously and intraperitoneally with a heavy suspension of Bacillus leprae. These animals were killed and examined three days later, but the bacilli were not demonstrable from the regions about the sites of inoculation. Pigeons are likewise refractory. It is impossible to cause a local reaction in these birds, and the injected bacilli disappear rapidly. Hence, probably no multiplication takes place in them. Goats, young pigs, and white and dancing mice are in a degree susceptible to injections, and though undoubted lesions are produced, and multiplication of the bacilli occurs, the lesions and bacilli disappear after a limited time. Acid-fast bacilli which are recovered from the lesions are long, slim, and beaded, though the organisms used in the inoculations were short, unbeaded, and coccoid. Monkeys inoculated with cultures of the short unbeaded forms react promptly. The lesions resulting, though confined in most instances to the site of inoculation, occasionally appear at distant points. The number of bacilli present in the nodules and their arrangement within typical lepra cells show that multiplication has taken place. The organism has, however, changed from the short coccoid form to the long, slender, beaded form. Though the lesions induced and the bacilli present are in every way similar to those found in man, their tendency to disappear gradually after a quiescent stage clearly denotes that the tissues of the monkey, although less refractory than the tissues of the animals previously mentioned, still offer resistance to invasion. While mammals react but poorly to inoculations of the leprosy bacillus, this reaction manifests itself in various ways in different species. For example, while multiplication of the organism with the production of lesions occurs in some species, in others that are more refractory, the injected bacilli assume the involuted or beaded forms and do not multiply or produce lesions; in others, still more resistant to the action of the leprosy bacillus, the organisms quickly undergo granular metamorphosis and disappear. Furthermore, in some species the lesions are, in most instances, limited to the site of inoculation, and though presenting all the characteristics of the lesion in man, the nodules and the bacilli disappear after a variable time. This behavior of the leprosy bacillus can be accounted for only by the degree of resistance offered by the tissues of the individual host. Since the morphology of the organism invariably changes from the short coccoid to the large beaded form when placed in insusceptible animals, and conversely, from the long beaded forms to the short coccoid forms when placed in susceptible animals, the deduction can be drawn that the organism varies in morphology and rapidity of growth according to the susceptibility of the host. Examples of similar behavior of Bacillus leprae in the human subject are known to all investigators of leprosy. Ulcers and nodular areas often heal, and the bacilli disappear with little or no treatment. It is true that while older lesions are healing, new ones are constantly appearing, yet the duration of the disease and its undoubted tendency towards healing shows that conditions in the human subject are variable, and suggests that the organism has its natural habitat in some other host. The experiments presented here serve to show that the bacillus of leprosy meets but little or no resistance in the tissues of cold-blooded animals, multiplies in their tissues, and may be harbored by them without apparent discomfort or external evidence of the disease. That no appreciable resistance is offered to the multiplication of the leprosy bacillus by many species of cold-blooded animals is shown by the fact that aside from the trauma produced by the inoculation and the slight initial reaction of the tissues, the organism continues to grow profusely, and to invade the tissues without further reaction. Quite the opposite condition occurs in mammals: in some of these the leprosy bacillus degenerates into a granular mass shortly after inoculation; in others that are less refractory, typical lesions appear, but they seldom extend from the point of inoculation; and while the bacilli multiply slowly, they do not infiltrate the tissues, but disappear after a short time, the lesions healing. That multiplication of Bacillus leprae occurs in the tissues of cold-blooded animals is shown by the fact that while animals examined a few days after inoculation show but a few scattered organisms, those killed at longer intervals show a proportional increase in the number of bacilli. Furthermore, the few bacilli found at the early-period are extracellular and scattered, while after longer periods they tend to be massed and enclosed in large lepra cells. The supposition that these lepra cells are phagocytes has naturally arisen. Duval holds that they are not phagocytes in the true sense of the term, that the bacilli penetrate the cells rather than that the cells engulf them, after which, finding conditions for growth favorable, they multiply without causing serious injury to the cell. The size of the cell depends upon the size of the colony within. The experimental work bears out this view since the decrease in number of the organisms observed in animals killed shortly after inoculation depends not upon phagocytic action nor upon cells which appear later when active lesions are established. In early lesions, the lepra cells are smaller, barely measuring twenty to thirty microns in diameter, and contain but few bacilli; whereas in older ones, they attain a diameter of 100 microns or even more, and contain enormous numbers of bacilli. Were this increase in size due to phagocytic action, some cells would be found in which the limit of their capacity had been reached; and they would either contain a mass of dead and disintegrated bacteria or would themselves show evidence of disintegration. On the contrary, the bacilli, though they occupy most of the cell, show no signs of disintegration, and the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the cell retain normal staining properties. That the invasion and multiplication of the bacilli cause an irritation is evident by the amitotic divisions of the nucleus which occur in the larger cells. The absence of external evidence of invasion by Bacillus leprae in cold-blooded animals, and the apparent lack of discomfort caused by the presence of the organism within their tissues, are points which should be remembered in considering the sources from which leprosy may be transmitted. In not a single instance in the numerous experiments presented here would it have been possible, from any external sign, to suspect that the animals were harboring multitudes of leprosy bacilli. While the evidence in support of the opinion that leprosy may be transmitted from man to man appears sufficiently strong to warrant this belief, the number of cases in which infection can be actually traced to this source is small. Since leprosy is known to be prevalent where fish and sea-food are plentiful, and since the experiments here recorded prove that fish can be infected by being fed cultures of Bacillus leprae, or nodules from human lepers, or bits of fish previously infected with the leprosy organism, account should be taken of the possibility that leprosy, in certain localities, may arise from this source of infection. The question as to how and from what source leprosy bacilli enter the human body may be still regarded as an open one. Isolated examples of direct infection of healthy human beings from lepers have been reported by Arning and Nonne, by Manson, and others. The notion that the agency of infection is already infected human beings, that is lepers, is at the foundation of the modern practice of the isolation and segregation of lepers, which would seem to have brought about a definite decrease in the prevalence of the disease.

Irrespective of whether detectable symptoms of clinical poliomyelitis do or do not arise in the nasally instilled animals, the cerebrospinal fluid changes quickly in response to virus placed in the nasal passages. Two sets of changes occur in the cerebrospinal fluid: the constant and most pronounced change consists of increase in the content of white cells, chiefly of the lymphocytic type; the inconstant and less profound one consists of detectable amounts of globulin in the fluid (free from red corpuscles) withdrawn by cisterna puncture. As early as 48 hours after instillation of the virus, a marked increase in cells is already detectable in the fluid; the increase grows from day to day, reaching a maximum sometimes in another day or two, sometimes not until 4, 5, or 6 more days elapse. In many instances a rise of temperature follows or coincides with the rising tide of cells; and the onset of clinical symptoms of disease bears also a relation to the cell count. The number of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and the temperatures tend to be higher in monkeys which develop paralytic symptoms; occasionally exceptions to this rule occur, in which instilled monkeys remaining asymptomatic exhibit high cell counts; very rarely do the latter show the higher temperatures. Monkeys once instilled which fail to become symptomatically affected again react by cerebrospinal fluid changes to later courses of instillation. A second or still later course may induce paralysis; or highly exceptional or refractory animals may go through several courses of instillation without developing clinical symptoms, although never failing to respond with changes in the cerebrospinal fluid. The virus instillations of Macacus monkeys do not lead to active immunization unless clinical symptoms of infection have resulted from the inoculations and attended the cerebrospinal fluid changes. In the complete absence of clinical symptoms the instilled animals fail to develop blood antiviral properties, and they are as susceptible to the cerebral injection of virus as are the control monkeys. On the other hand, instilled monkeys which have shown even mild and fleeting (abortive) clinical symptoms of infection, resist cerebral inoculation and exhibit blood antiviral or neutralizing properties. Monkeys which have developed clinical symptoms of disease and have recovered are, as stated, actively immunized; they remain, however, sensitive to the presence of virus on the nasal membrane, reacting with cerebrospinal fluid changes, differing only in degree from the nonimmune animals. Detectable virus does not appear in the pleocytic cerebrospinal fluid at any stage of the pathological processes. The current belief is that mass immunization is proceeding in an unperceived manner through the chance entrance of virus into the nasal passages of children. It is not known whether, apart from all symptoms of disease, cerebrospinal fluid changes occur in the course of this unexpressed, spontaneous process. A large gap seems to exist between man and the monkey in the capacity of the former to become immunized by way of the nasal membrane, and the inability of the latter to do so. It is common knowledge that monkeys do not become immune through unsuccessful cerebral inoculations of virus, and the same seems to be true of the nasal channel of virus penetration into the central nervous organs.", "pubdate_sims": "1935-11-30"}, "19870129": {"title": "BIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF THE TUBERCLE BACILLUS : II. A NEW CONCEPTION OF THE PATHOLOGY OF EXPERIMENTAL AVIAN TUBERCULOSIS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE DISEASE PRODUCED BY DISSOCIATED VARIANTS.", "abstract": "In the preceding pages we have presented evidence which we believe furnishes new light on the disease process in avian tuberculosis. From a well known strain of avian tubercle bacillus, A(1), four variants have been dissociated, each manifesting distinct colony topography and physical and chemical characteristics. From these studies we have learned that the variants are sometimes unstable, not only in vitro but also in vivo, and that this characteristic is one of the prominent factors influencing both the advancement and retrogression of the disease. The four variants remain fairly stable in vitro provided they are cultivated on proper culture media. About 80 per cent smooth S and flat smooth F.S. colonies will develop true to type on egg media; and rough R and the chromogenic Ch when cultivated on gycerine agar media, in about the same percentage. An early non-specific eosinophilia followed inoculation, no matter which variant was used. This usually subsided by the 18th hour. The early stages of tubercle formation produced by all the variants appeared similar. First there appeared an aggregation of eosinophiles and their ingested bacilli within the tissues and then followed replacement by large mononuclear cells which wandered in and phagocyted both eosinophiles and bacilli. After the formation of tubercles composed only of large mononuclear cells, certain differences between the virulent and avirulent variants became apparent. There was also a direct relationship between the dosage and the extent of the disease. In our experience from 0.16 to 0.25 mg. gave the most uniform results. If S variant was used, the early non-specific eosinophilia was followed by a second rise which continued to ascend, running parallel with the total leucocyte count. There was a slow increase of monocytes and a corresponding decrease of lymphocytes. The microscopic lesions, 2 weeks after inoculation, were composed of irregularly shaped clumps of necrosing large mononuclear cells. The margins were clear-cut and bordered by few or no lymphocytic cells. By the 3rd and 4th weeks eosinophiles began to migrate into the centers of the tubercles and abscess formation became evident. Death usually occurred after 5 or 6 weeks, although this varied with the dosage. The appearance of the lesions suggested an acute \"toxic\" nature, as manifested (1) by marked enlargement of the spleen and liver, (2) by the short fatal course of the disease, which never became very extensive, (3) by the presence of few organisms within the tubercles, (4) by destruction of reticulum and (5) by the marked response of the blood leucocytes. After inoculation with F.S. variant the early non-specific eosinophilia disappeared, returning again at the terminal stage, 5 to 6 weeks later. The number of eosinophiles then ascended sharply, accompanied by a marked leucocytosis which continued until death. During this eosinophilia a monocytosis occurred and lymphocytes fell away rapidly. During the 2nd week, clumps of closely packed large mononuclear cells containing masses of phagocyted bacilli were seen. In the 3rd and 4th weeks there appeared a prominent peripheral zone of hyalin, collagenous-like material associated with an increased reticulum formation which apparently walled off the lesion. The bacilli within the tubercle multiplied rapidly, it seemed as though they were more resistant to destruction than the S organisms, perhaps due to their higher lipin content. As a result of their rapid increase, progression of the tubercle continued, with necrosis and abscess formation, accompanied by the dissemination of the organisms both locally and distantly to new uninvolved tissue. Wide extension of the disease followed due to the increase in numbers of bacilli, terminating with death usually during the 5th and 6th weeks. The manifestations of \"toxin\" damage shown in S disease were not so marked until the approach of the end-stage. We interpret the type of lesion produced by the F.S. variant as a foreign body tubercle to distinguish it from the acute \"toxic\" nature of the S. A quantitative chemical determination showed that this organism contained 20.14 per cent lipin whereas in the S variant it was only 15.03 per cent. Following inoculation with R variant the initial eosinophilia returned to normal within 24 hours. There was then an increase of both lymphocytes and monocytes, the latter exceeding the former for a time. Later, usually after the 2nd month, the lymphocytes again became predominant over the monocytes, approaching the normal base line. Eosinophiles failed to react. This blood picture indicated a successful resistance against the infecting organisms, and was supported by the pathological findings. None of the chickens of this group died during the period of study (79 days) although infecting doses of 0.25 mg. were used. Necropsies on four chickens revealed no macroscopic evidence of disease approximately 11 weeks after inoculation. Microscopic lesions were present in the spleen and liver of some cases. In chickens inoculated 11 weeks previously these tubercles consisted only of very small, discrete clumps of degenerating mononuclear cells often surrounded by a border of lymphocytes. Necrosis, abscess formation or caseation was not found. Their small size and appearance was evidence of their retrogressive character. Isolated giant cells were rarely seen. It was impossible to find bacilli within these tubercles. In one instance it was possible to show complete innocuousness of this organism in the tissues, as far as producing recognizable tuberculous lesions. Reticulum played little part in the development of the lesion and it was neither increased or destroyed. Following inoculation with the chromogenic Ch variant the initial eosinophilia declined by the 24th or 42nd hour count and from then on remained low. The lymphocytes showed little decrease. A prominent monocytosis of prolonged character usually occurred during the 3rd to 6th weeks and was then displaced by a return of the lymphocytes. By the end of the period of observation the differential count had closely approached the normal values. Again the blood picture was truly representative of the relatively benign character of the lesions. The tubercle formation, even after 93 days' duration of the disease, remained limited to small clumps of two or three large mononuclear cells showing some degeneration. Lymphocytic cells were usually present within and about the lesion. There was never any evidence of abscess formation or actual necrosis. Bacilli could not be found within these tubercles. The reticulum in relation to the lesion showed neither increase nor destruction. None of the chickens died though a dose of 0.5 mg. was used. In three chickens infected with S variant, the blood picture did not follow the pattern set by the others similarly inoculated. Either a high monocytosis replaced the usual eosinophilia, or there was a marked recession of the total leucocyte count followed by a return of lymphocytes towards normal percentage. The blood picture indicated the conversion of an acute process into a subacute or chronic affair. These chickens survived for 78, 79 and 110 days, respectively. An explanation for this occurred to us later when cultures recovered from them, instead of consisting of S colonies, showed the topography of the intermediate type, closely resembling the F.S. type. Evidently this was due to a reversion; i.e., a loss of virulence of the organism occurring within the animal body. At necropsy the spleen and liver were somewhat enlarged and contained prominent, discrete yellow nodules resembling small shot in their size and shape, which, in one case could be lifted from the tissue by the point of the knife. Microscopically, they possessed small centers of caseation surrounded by numerous giant cells and large mononuclear cells with a thick border of lymphocytic cells. This tubercle formation could not be classified in any special group as it was too sharply circumscribed and walled off by lymphocytic cells to be considered as truly malignant in nature as the S type of lesion. Even the younger tubercles in these cases, which consisted of clumped epithelioid cells with prominent lymphocytic cell borders, could not be called acute or \"toxic\" in character. At present we make only limited deductions from our observations. In the bacterial dissociation phenomenon we have at least a new line of investigation, and different variants of tubercle bacilli must be taken into consideration when planning new tuberculosis studies. With the stabilization of the human type variants, experiments such as reported here may bring about the proper clinical interpretation, of the course of human tuberculosis.", "pubdate_sims": "1933-01-31"}, "19870482": {"title": "STUDIES ON PSEUDORABIES (INFECTIOUS BULBAR PARALYSIS, MAD ITCH : III. THE DISEASE IN THE RHESUS MONKEY, MACACA MULATTA.", "abstract": "In the monkey (M. mulatto) the virus of pseudorabies, pantropic in the rabbit, behaves as a strict neurotrope. Infection, usually fatal, readily follows intracerebral and intracisternal inoculation of rabbit virus, and often intrasciatic inoculation; the symptomatology of the ensuing disease is described. In a limited number of experiments no infection resulted from intradermal, intramuscular or intravenous inoculation. Nerve and glial cells are primarily attacked by the virus, but no cytological or other evidence of susceptibility of non-nervous tissue or of growth of virus outside the nervous system was obtained. Certain cortical areas, of which the principal are the pyriform area, cornu Ammonis, island of Reil, lower lip of the Sylvian fissure and basal surface of the frontal lobe, are affected far more severely than are other parts of the nervous axis; the reasons for this elective distribution of the most severe lesions, seen alike after intracerebral and intrasciatic inoculation and analogous perhaps to that in poliomyelitis and louping-ill, are not obvious. Other areas of the nervous system are relatively insusceptible to the action of the virus. Cases showing clinically only a febrile reaction without definite nervous symptoms may later exhibit marked residual lesions at the sites of election. The blood and cerebrospinal fluid play no apparent r\u00f4le in disseminating the virus, which, after intrasciatic inoculation, spreads upwards by the nervous path. Some suggestion was received from the experiments that in monkeys possessed of immunity to B virus (Sabin and Wright, 1934) pseudorabic infection is less likely to prove fatal than in animals not so immune, but the observations made were insufficiently numerous to be of statistical value. The sera of 6 out of 26 monkeys were found to contain antibodies neutralising B virus; these 6 monkeys were all included in one batch of 7 received at one time from the dealer.", "pubdate_sims": "1936-02-29"}, "19870235": {"title": "ACUTE ASCENDING MYELITIS FOLLOWING A MONKEY BITE, WITH THE ISOLATION OF A VIRUS CAPABLE OF REPRODUCING THE DISEASE.", "abstract": "A case of acute ascending myelitis which followed the bite of an apparently normal Macacus rhesus monkey is described. The clinical course as well as the pathological changes has been studied and found to be suggestive of a virus cause for the disease. The absence of perivascular demyelinization removes the case from the realm of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and establishes it more or less definitely as a primary acute infectious myelitis. An extremely important feature of the pathological picture of this disease has been the presence of focal necrosis in the viscera (spleen, adrenals, regional lymph nodes). Attempts to transmit the disease to Macacus rhesus monkeys, dogs, mice, and guinea pigs, employing glycerinated organs from the human case, proved unsuccessful. By the inoculations of rabbits the presence of a strongly neurotropic, filtrable virus was demonstrated in the patient's brain, cord, and spleen. Following intracutaneous injection of it as derived either from brain and cord or spleen, an experimental disease develops in rabbits which strikingly resembles the human disease in the character of the local lesion, the incubation period, development of urinary retention, and flaccid paralysis of the posterior extremities with cephalad progression, death by respiratory failure, and finally by the occurrence of focal necrosis in the spleen, adrenals, and liver. In attempting to establish the identity of this virus, (the B virus), a consideration of its biological properties excludes the viruses of poliomyelitis, rabies, vaccinia, Virus III disease of rabbits, and the other viruses which are known to produce similar intranuclear inclusion bodies, except perhaps herpes. Although the relationship between the B virus and the virus of herpes must still be determined by cross-immunity tests it has been shown to possess certain properties which warrant consideration of it as a distinct entity.", "pubdate_sims": "1934-01-31"}, "19867762": {"title": "THE RELATION TO THE BLOOD OF THE VIRUS OF EPIDEMIC POLIOMYELITIS.", "abstract": "Specimens of human blood taken during the paralytic stage of poliomyelitis and post mortem have proved not to be capable of infecting Macacus monkeys. Specimens of monkey blood taken at various stages of experimental poliomyelitis have not proved as a rule to be capable of infecting monkeys. In a single instance, among ten tests, infection was secured with a specimen of blood removed at the beginning of the paralysis on the seventh day following an intracerebral inoculation. When suspensions of the spinal cord from a paralyzed monkey have been injected into the brain or simultaneously into the brain and spinal canal, the blood removed from one to forty-eight hours later failed to cause paralysis after intracerebral injection. When large volumes of active filtrate are injected into the circulation the blood remains infective for seventy-two hours at least, but may be no longer infective after ten days when the paralytic symptoms first appear. When, however, the filtrate is injected in smaller amount or when a filtrate of a less active virus is employed in large quantity, the blood either fails to convey infection or conveys it irregularly. It is only when overwhelming quantities of an active virus are injected into the blood that paralysis results. The injection of moderate doses is not followed by paralysis, although the virus may still be detected in a blood sample twenty-four hours after the injection. The existence of a mechanism capable of excluding the virus within the blood from the central nervous organs is therefore inferred. Infection is accomplished far less readily through the circulation than by means of the more direct lymphatic and nervous channels of communication with the central nervous system. Several series of feeding experiments conducted with the biting stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) resulted negatively.", "pubdate_sims": "1914-03-01"}, "19870511": {"title": "PROTECTIVE ACTION OF CERTAIN CHEMICALS AGAINST INFECTION OF MONKEYS WITH NASALLY INSTILLED POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS.", "abstract": "In the present investigation evidence was obtained indicating that nasal instillations of suitable concentrations of sodium alum or tannic acid induce in Macacus rhesus monkeys resistance to the development of poliomyelitis when the virus is introduced by the nasal route. It was found that apparently different concentrations of these chemicals are required to exert this type of protective effect in different hosts or against different viruses, for while mice are readily protected against nasal infection with equine encephalomyelitis virus by 0.5 per cent solutions of tannic acid or alum (7), monkeys require at least 3 per cent solutions to become resistant against poliomyelitis. Experiments designed to elucidate the development of this refractory state in monkeys indicate that it is a result of the action of these chemicals not upon the virus but rather upon the tissues of the host (probably the olfactory mucosa); further evidence in favor of this hypothesis may be found in the observation that several days of treatment are required before resistance is induced. While one nasal instillation a day for 3 days proved effective when additional treatments were given on the days of virus administration, there was no protection against infection when the virus was given 48 and 96 hours after the last treatment. The resistance which was demonstrable when the virus was instilled intranasally on the 4th and 6th days after the beginning of treatment was also found to be present a week later when the treatments were given daily, indicating that the refractory state can be maintained in this manner. It was observed, however, that monkeys which were given nasal instillations of alum or tannic acid for 5 days or more may retain the resistance they acquired for 1 or 2 months without any additional treatment (Table V); thus, of 15 refractory monkeys retested after 1 month, 11 were still resistant; seven of 15 monkeys were refractory when retested after 2 months, while only one of 11 failed to develop poliomyelitis after an interval of 3 months. These last results suggest that to maintain such a refractory state over a period of months it may be necessary to employ daily instillations only for about a week, with subsequent repetitions at intervals of several days or a week. An experiment performed to determine the effect of beginning alum treatment soon after, rather than before, the virus is administered, indicated that there is no danger from a possible early or primary effect enhancing the invasiveness of the virus. One cannot state with any certainty, however, whether or not in some of the monkeys so treated the development of poliomyelitis is inhibited or prevented. Finally, it should be stressed that treatment with alum or tannic acid either completely prevented the disease in monkeys, or else was entirely without effect. It is therefore not surprising that no evidence was obtained of development of specific, active immunity in monkeys rendered refractory by chemical treatment. As far as could be ascertained, the nasal instillation of tannic acid or alum in man proved thoroughly innocuous beyond some local irritation for a short time. The desirability of testing this procedure as an aid in the prevention of poliomyelitis in man during the months of greatest incidence or during epidemics is quite apparent. In conclusion, there may be broader implications in this approach to the prevention of certain infectious diseases transmitted naturally or experimentally by way of the nose. It seems desirable to make studies with other viruses transmitted by the nasal route, including those of influenza and the common cold. The evidence obtained in the present study that the chemically induced refractory state may persist in a large number of monkeys for a month or two after treatment over a period of 5 days or more, suggests that studies on individuals who are subject to frequent attacks of common cold may perhaps be profitable.", "pubdate_sims": "1936-05-31"}, "19870237": {"title": "COMPARATIVE STUDIES ON THE VIRUSES OF VESICULAR STOMATITIS AND EQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS (1).", "abstract": "We have studied certain properties, additional to those previously described (3), of the virus of vesicular stomatitis of horses, and of the characteristic biological reactions of the virus of equine encephalomyelitis. It has been found that the virus of stomatitis, ordinarily dermotropic, can acquire neurotropism and the neurotropic encephalomyelitis virus can, in turn, be rendered dermotropic in its action. The neurotropism in both instances is associated with definite, although not pronounced, viscerotropism. Both viruses can bring about a similar infection in the white mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys. Of these animals, rabbits show the lowest degree of susceptibility and mice the highest, especially after intracerebral inoculation. The mouse is the best animal for work with these viruses because of the uniform and rapidly lethal encephalitis which can be induced in it. Moreover, the mouse is highly sensitive to the instillation of the viruses in the nasal passages: 1 to 10 million dilution sufficing to induce a fatal encephalitis. The uninjured nasal mucosa of mice appears, therefore, to be as susceptible to experimental infection as the traumatized brain or pads of animals. The microscopic changes accompanying the reactions to both viruses reveal, in rapidly lethal infections, pronounced destructive lesions in the cells of the central nervous system. When the experimental disease is more protracted in its course, however, these lesions are associated with beginning productive, inflammatory reactions, consisting chiefly of mononuclear infiltrations. In the latter instances, characteristic, intranuclear inclusion bodies can be more readily observed. Both viruses can be cultivated with facility in the medium of minced chicken embryonic tissue suspended in Tyrode's solution, although 24 to 48 hour old chicks are refractory to artificial infection. No cross-immunity reactions occur between the two strains of stomatitis virus or between them and the encephalomyelitis strain. The viruses are evidently similar in many biological properties. In view of the fact that the horse is the natural host for both, it is suggested that they may be generically related. They are not, of course, identical since cross-immunity between them does not exist. The absence of cross-immunity does not, however, exclude the possibility of a generic relationship, for there are at least three immunologically distinct types of foot-and-mouth disease, two of vesicular stomatitis, and two of equine encephalomyelitis (14) virus.", "pubdate_sims": "1934-01-31"}, "19867463": {"title": "EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNITY WITH REFERENCE TO THE BACILLUS OF LEPROSY : PART I. A STUDY OF THE FACTORS DETERMINING INFECTION IN ANIMALS.", "abstract": "Repeated experiments have proven that few, if any, of the ordinary laboratory and domestic animals are immune against infection by Bacillus leprae. As previously reported, the goat, horse, guinea pig, and many cold-blooded animals (Couret) have been found susceptible to invasion by this organism. Two factors are of great importance in effecting infection. In the first place, a sufficiently large number of organisms must be employed, and, what is still more important, second and subsequent inoculations are more liable to produce leprous lesions than are primary injections. Moderate doses used in the first inoculation of animals are comparatively harmless as regards their ability to induce lesions. Such preliminary doses, whether they consist of living or dead organisms, produce a condition of hypersensitiveness or allergy, which renders it possible by a second injection of viable bacilli to induce the development of a reactionary lesion. Lesions arising as the result of a second inoculation develop more rapidly, increase in size more quickly, and persist for a longer period than those taking place as the result of a single inoculation, even though very large doses are used. Moreover, the bacilli in these lesions are more liable to lead to metastasis and to a generalized infection. We regard the results of these experiments as having considerable bearing upon the development of the disease in human cases, since we find that it is chiefly among those living in prolonged intimate contact with leprous patients that leprosy develops. The proper interpretation of these findings is difficult and becomes, apparently, more complex the longer they are studied. We are accustomed to similar phenomena of anaphylaxis or allergy with protein materials and with certain bacteria, especially the tubercle bacillus. It is not surprising that a specific allergy or altered reaction should take place in animals previously injected with leprosy bacilli, either alive or dead; why, however, lesions should develop in which the bacilli continue to grow in animals which had recovered from previous injections, or the serum of which showed bactericidal properties and contained other specific antibodies, is not so easily understood. It is unnecessary in this paper to discuss the relative value of the different theories brought forward to explain the phenomenon of anaphylaxis. It must, nevertheless, be assumed that either as the result of the splitting of certain essentially non-toxic substances in the bacillus by specific ferment-like substances in the blood, which increase after a sensitizing dose, or by the joining of some body in the serum with certain substances in the bacilli, a toxic body is produced. Following the setting free or development of these injurious bodies, there results a cellular reaction, an area of local necrosis followed usually by the appearance of cells of the lymphoid and epithelioid type, and, especially if dead bacilli are used, by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Such a reaction is usual in all allergic or anaphylactic conditions; but why the reaction should pre-dispose to the more or less permanent development of parasitic powers on the part of the bacilli is not so plain. The idea has been expressed by us, as the result of observations based chiefly upon the study of the changes in the tissues of human leprosy, that the presence of bacilli within the large multinucleated cells that are characteristic of the lesion is the result of active multiplication of the bacilli in these cells rather than of phagocytosis by the cells, although it is possible that their original entrance may be the result of phagocytic action. If this be the case, it is possible that, through the cellular reaction plus the necrosis of certain of the fixed tissue cells, a pabulum of split protein products results upon which the bacilli feed, and in which they find protection from the antibodies present in the blood serum. In our attempts to induce infection in various mammalian species with cultures of human leprosy, positive results have been obtained in almost every instance after the second injection of large numbers of the organism. In this manner, we have been successful in the production of lesions in the monkey, goat, horse, guinea pig, and mouse. The results of these experiments lead us to believe that the mechanism through which invasion and multiplication follows in these lower animals is similar to if not identical with that in man. A careful study of the progress of the disease in man together with the behavior of the organism in the monkey and the goat would suggest, at least, that the function of toxin production is, after all, of little use to the leprosy bacillus because it has seemingly acquired a highly parasitic existence; instead of which it is not only possible, but highly probable, that its defensive protection, whatever it may be, is enormously developed. After the inoculation of animals with either dead or living bacilli, the production of specific antibodies is induced; these do not develop in any considerable amount and apparently show no marked tendency to increase upon repeated injections. The tests of the sera in vitro indicate that the antisubstances are produced chiefly by the first few injections. Either the existence of some specific bacterial protective body, or what seems more probable, the protection afforded by the host cells in which the bacilli become ensconsed accounts, we believe, for the difficulty of producing in animals an antiserum of high potency. The idea, too, that the bacilli do not multiply to any great extent until they have entered certain cells of the host has, in a large measure, been verified by the artificial cultivation experiments. We know from our studies upon the biology of the organism that it will live for years in the most unfavorable conditions. This would suggest that during their sojourn in the tissue cells death as the result of autolysis rarely occurs, and as long as the cells can withstand the multiplication of the bacilli within and remain alive, so long are the bacilli protected from outside injurious influences, in consequence of which no disintegration of bacilli occurs to induce the production of immune bodies. On the other hand, death of the cells carrying the bacilli must occur from time to time, and this exposes large numbers of the organisms to the action of the body fluids, and, in consequence, to the condition of formation of specific antibodies.", "pubdate_sims": "1911-08-01"}, "19870368": {"title": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON ENCEPHALITIS : II.

Upon inoculation into monkeys poliomyelitis may fail to appear upon the first injection and yet follow from the effects of successive injections of the culture. Inoculations of cultures into monkeys which fail to produce paralysis may fail also to induce resistance or immunity. In this respect the action of the cultures resembles that of the virus as contained in infected nervous tissues. The lesions occurring in the spinal cord, medulla, and intervertebral ganglia of the monkeys which respond to the several inoculations of the cultures are identical with those present in the nervous organs of the animals responding to injection of the ordinary virus. Glycerinated nervous tissues derived from the monkeys responding to several injections of the cultures transmit experimental poliomyelitis to monkeys upon intracerebral inoculation. The micro\u00f6rganism inoculated may be recovered in cultures from the monkeys which develop poliomyelitis; but cultivation from the brain tissue is attended with the usual difficulties surrounding the obtaining of the initial growth. The micro\u00f6rganism cultivated from poliomyelitic tissues is adapted with difficulty to saprophytic conditions of multiplication, but once adapted growth readily takes place upon suitable media.

Centrifugal spread from the infected nervous tissues by the neural route also occurs. After intracerebral inoculation the virus passes in the reverse direction, down the nervous axis. The Aujeszky strain invades the blood stream more readily than does the Iowa strain; but possibly with repeated passage the latter is approximating in this respect more closely the classical Aujeszky strain. After intravenous inoculation, effective with even small doses, virus is rapidly removed from the blood, and multiple infective foci are established in various organs; thence ascent of the virus by the peripheral nerves leads to infection of the central nervous system, the symptomatology differing according to whether the spinal cord or the medulla is first reached. The lack of evidence that the virus can penetrate directly the hemato-encephalic barrier deserves emphasis. When subcutaneous inoculation is practised in an area deprived of its nerve supply, the ability of the virus to invade the blood stream permits it to establish infective foci in the various viscera, and, after a predictable delay, the course of infection resembles that following intravenous injection. The pseudorabies virus is pantropic; i.e., it readily attacks cells derived from any embryonic layer.

The infection ascends the peripheral nerve (possibly both interstitially and by the axis-cylinders) to the corresponding spinal ganglia and segments of the spinal cord, where primary degeneration of nerve and glial cells takes place.

Intracerebral inoculation is followed by characteristic lesions in the meninges, in subpial glial cells and in superficially placed nerve cells. Morbid changes in the lungs are not necessarily related to the presence of virus, but specific lesions may be present. Intranuclear inclusions bearing some resemblance to those in herpetic encephalitis, yellow fever, etc., occur in cells derived from all embryonic layers. The disease in the guinea pig resembles closely that in the rabbit and is modified only by the slightly greater resistance of the animal. In the monkey after intracerebral inoculation, widespread degeneration and necrosis of cortical nerve cells are accompanied by the appearance of specific nuclear alterations in nerve and glial cells, but not in cells of mesodermal origin.

The temperature curve may serve to indicate the time for reinjection. 8. The favorable results thus far achieved in human beings by means of the immune serum support and extend those obtained experimentally in monkeys and indicate, as was foreseen, that the milder or less fatal form of poliomyelitis appearing in man is even more amenable to the serum treatment than is the highly fatal disease produced by inoculation in monkeys.", "pubdate_sims": "1917-04-01"}, "19869852": {"title": "IMMUNIZATION WITH MIXTURES OF POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS AND ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE.", "abstract": "Preliminary experiments are presented which indicate that poliomyelitis virus can be inactivated by a certain preparation of aluminum hydroxide.

In case the previous infection is of very recent date, reinoculation may lead to no demonstrable reaction whatsoever. 3. Monkeys, which have received a number of parenteral injections of live virus, respond to intracerebral infection with a precocious and prolonged febrile reaction on the 3rd or 4th day after infection which may last until the onset of symptoms. 4.

The disease occurs in all parts of the United States, Holland, Austria and probably South America. 3. The disease appears to be endemic in certain foci. Having once appeared, the disease tends to persist through successive years. 4. It occurs with about equal frequency in both sexes; all common breeds may be affected. 5. Symptoms appear between the 3rd and 18th months. Typical clinical cases have not been observed outside of these limits. 6. The conspicuous symptoms are (a) asymmetrical, partial and progressive paralysis of the wings and both legs, and rarely of neck muscles; (b) occasional grey discoloration of iris, with blindness. Nutrition is usually preserved. 7. The duration is variable; the outcome is usually fatal, but spontaneous recovery may rarely occur. 8. The principal pathological changes are found in the nervous system. In the peripheral nerves, the essential feature is an intense infiltration of lymphoid, plasma cells, and large mononuclears. This is accompanied by a myelin degeneration in the more advanced lesions, but the cellular infiltrations appear to precede the degenerative changes. In brain, cord and meninges, there are similar infiltrations predominantly perivascular. Infiltrations of the iris with lymphoid and plasma cells are found in the cases showing gross discoloration of the iris. Visceral lymphomata, originating usually in the ovary, are associated in a certain percentage of the cases. Evidence is presented in favor of the view that this association is not accidental, and that the lymphomata are a manifestation of the disease. 9. Infiltrations of the spinal cord and brain, rarely of the peripheral nerves, are frequently present in birds showing no clinical symptoms. These are interpreted as mild cases of the same disease. 10.

The specimens tested had been kept for 4 and 6 years respectively in 50 per cent glycerol at refrigerator temperature. The symptoms and lesions caused by this virus are identical with those produced by that contained in the more recently collected spinal cord and medulla. The specimens had lost a part of their activity under the conditions described, necessitating larger and repeated doses to induce infection. Whether this difference is due merely to quantitative reduction in number of viable microorganisms or to qualitative alterations under the influence of the mildly antiseptic glycerol has not been determined. An ineffective inoculation of tissues containing the virus does not increase resistance, but rather diminishes it, so that a subsequent injection, inadequate in itself, may cause experimental poliomyelitis. This power of survival under adverse conditions may not be without significance in respect to the recrudescence of poliomyelitis in a given locality and after a lapse of years. Hitherto this phenomenon has been accounted for by assuming a fresh importation of a virus of pronounced pathogenic power. It is possible that the explanation in some instances resides in the renewed activity of specimens of the virus surviving from a previous epidemic, while in other instances a fresh introduction actually takes place from a remote focus of infection.

The virulence of the virus was maintained by ice box storage of infected tissues for as long as 127 days. The pathogenic properties of the virus persisted under conditions of animal passage for the 9 months from January to October, 1933, covered by these studies. The reaction produced in rabbits by the inoculation of tissue-virus emulsions was of two principal types, the first of which has been described and analyzed in the present paper. In the case of intratesticular injections, particularly of testicular tissue inocula, an acute fulminating and rapidly fatal condition regularly developed. The outstanding features were a massive hemorrhagic orchitis with marked scrotal edema, fever, and death within a week. The second type of reaction which is taken up in the next paper of this series (1) was observed under conditions in which the animal survived a week or longer. Occasional examples occurred in rabbits of the so called intratesticular series.

Its main indications were for intractable mental illness, in particular, depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. However, its side effects, especially the 'frontal lobe syndrome', led to the need for more refined surgical approaches; the most important of these was the use of stereotaxis. Cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, limbic leucotomy, and anterior capsulotomy are generally the stereotactic treatments of choice today. Indications and postoperative sequelae vary slightly across treatments. The indications remain as affective, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.

Dr Newbold postulates that Mr Duke was neurologically impaired as a result of vitamin B-12 deficiency and that he suffered from depression. In an attempt to relieve this depression, Dr Newbold argues that James B Duke donated the money necessary to found Duke University. Had he been properly treated for pernicious anemia, James Duke might have not been depressed nor made his donation. The historical record does not substantiate this hypothesis. Dr George Minot, Novel Laureate for his work on pernicious anemia, was a consultant to Mr Duke's physicians, and felt that the patient did not have pernicious anemia.

However, the sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilation in animals treated with indomethacin was not altered during infusion of PGI2 or PGE2.
